<h1 id="generating-index-recommendations-to-improve-query-performance-index-advisor">Generating index recommendations to improve query performance (Index Advisor)</h1>

<p>You can use the Index Advisor feature to generate recommendations for creating, altering, or dropping indexes that can improve the performance of the query. This feature provides the DDL scripts that you can run and information about the existing indexes from the query that you’re tuning.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> This feature requires a Db2 Query Workload Tuner for z/OS (QWTz) license. Make sure you have a valid license installed before you use this feature. See <a href="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/docs/tuning-sql-queries/sql-tuning-requirements.html">Software requirements for using the SQL tuning features</a> for more information.</p>

    <p>Open an SQL file and click on the connection in the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface">Status Bar</a>. Select a Db2 connection from the list that’s displayed. If you are using a tuning profile, make sure the connection that you select already has a tuning profile associated with it. If not, see <a href="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/docs/tuning-sql-queries/setting-up-a-tuning-environment.html#optional-creating-a-tuning-profile">Creating a tuning profile</a>.</p>
