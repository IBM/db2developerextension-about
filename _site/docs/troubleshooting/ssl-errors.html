<h2 id="version-compatibility-issue">Version compatibility issue</h2>

<p>If you’re using SSL to connect to Db2 for z/OS, you might receive an error if the TLS version on the z/OS system is at a lower level than the TLS version on your client.</p>

<p>z/OS supports TLS 1.0 and 1.1, which have been deprecated in favor of 1.2 or 1.3 by many clients. To correct this situation, you must take one of the following actions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Upgrade TLS on z/OS</strong></p>

    <p>Contact your security administrator who is responsible for administering SSL connectivity and ask them to upgrade the TLS version on the z/OS system to 1.2 or 1.3. If this isn’t feasible, reconfigure your client to accept TLS 1.0 or 1.1 connections as described below.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reconfigure your workstation to accept TLS 1.0 or 1.1 connections</strong></p>

    <p>If the TLS version on z/OS can’t be upgraded, you’ll need to enable Java on your workstation to accept TLS 1.0 or 1.1 connections.</p>

    <p><strong>Important:</strong> The following process will affect all applications that use the version of Java that you are modifying. Consider this impact before you complete these steps.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Edit the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.security</code> JDK file on your workstation. The location of this file depends on the version of Java that you’re using.
        <ul>
          <li>If you’re using Java 8, it’s located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security</code></li>
          <li>If you’re using Java 11 or later, it’s located at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$JAVA_HOME/conf/security/java.security</code></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Locate the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms</code> property within the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">java.security</code> file and delete the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLSv1</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">TLSv1.1</code> entries.</li>
      <li>Save and close the file.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>
