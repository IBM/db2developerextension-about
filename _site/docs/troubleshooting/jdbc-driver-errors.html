<p>When you attempt to connect to a Db2 for z/OS database for the first time and it’s running on Db2 13 function level 100, one of the following errors might be issued:</p>

<p><img src="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/assets/images/jdbc-4222.png" alt="Failure to connect with -4222" /></p>

<p><img src="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/assets/images/jdbc-internal-error.png" alt="Failure to connect with internal error" /></p>

<p>If you fail to connect to your database the first time because of one of these errors, attempt to reconnect.</p>

<p>Similarly, when you attempt to connect using a profile with invalid credentials, the following error is issued:</p>

<p><img src="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/assets/images/invalid_credentials_error.png" alt="Internal error message for invalid credentials" /></p>
