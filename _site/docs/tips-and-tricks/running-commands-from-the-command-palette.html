<p>Visual Studio Code’s <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/userinterface#_command-palette">Command Palette</a> allows you to execute commands quickly without navigating through the user interface. Visual Studio Code provides built-in commands, and Db2 Developer Extension provides its own commands.</p>

<p>To run a Db2 Dev Extension command, open the <strong>Command Palette</strong> and start typing “Db2 Developer Extension.” You’ll be presented with a list of all the extension-related commands that you can execute.</p>
