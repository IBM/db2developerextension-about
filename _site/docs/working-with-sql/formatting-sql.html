<h1 id="formatting-sql">Formatting SQL</h1>

<p>Db2 Developer Extension takes advantage of VSCode’s <strong>Format Document</strong> and <strong>Format Selection</strong> capabilities by allowing you to format SQL within all SQL file types, including .ddl, .spsql, .sql, .javaspsql, and .udfsql files.</p>

<p>The ability to format your SQL makes it much easier to parse large blocks of code and to understand the relationship between different blocks of SQL elements and clauses.</p>

<p>The formatting actions are available from the editor context menu, as keyboard shortcuts, and from the <a href="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/docs/tips-and-tricks/running-commands-from-the-command-palette.html">Command Palette</a>.</p>
