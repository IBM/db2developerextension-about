<h1 id="running-sql-from-within-a-stored-procedure">Running SQL from within a stored procedure</h1>

<p>You can run SQL within a native stored procedure (NSP) body that contains SQL parameters and SQL variables. You’ll be prompted to specify values for them before the SQL executes. Note that built-in data types for each input variable are detected automatically and are set to the correct data type.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> Make sure you follow the best practices for coding column names and variable names in your SQL statements. See <a href="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/docs/troubleshooting/column-names-being-interpreted-as-variables">Column names being interpreted as variables</a> for more information.</p>

<p>Note that this feature applies to <strong>.spsql</strong> files only.</p>
