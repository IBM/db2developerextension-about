<h1 id="running-statements-from-your-query-history">Running statements from your query history</h1>

<p>Use the <strong>Run SQL From Query History</strong> action in the <strong>QUERY HISTORY</strong> view to easily modify and re-run SQL statements that you previously ran.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>From the <strong>QUERY HISTORY</strong> view, select an individual SQL statement or select the file that contains a group of statements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Right-click and select <strong>Run SQL From Query History</strong>. The statements open in an editor window. Any host variables and data types that you assigned during the previous run are preserved. However, you can modify them as needed.</p>

    <p>From here you can edit the SQL before re-running it, and you can modify the run options by right-clicking in the editor and selecting <strong>Run SQL Options</strong>.</p>
