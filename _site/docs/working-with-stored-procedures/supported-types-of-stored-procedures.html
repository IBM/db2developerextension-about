<p><a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPEK_13.0.0/apsg/src/tpc/db2z_storedprocedure.html">Stored procedures</a> are a powerful tool for increasing the performance and efficiency of distributed applications. Db2 Developer Extension supports the following types of stored procedures:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/docs/working-with-stored-procedures/creating-native-sql-stored-procedures.html">Db2 for z/OS native SQL stored procedures</a>, which are stored procedures that are written entirely in SQL and are created by using the <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSEPEK_13.0.0/sqlref/src/tpc/db2z_sql_createproceduresqlnative.html">CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE  OR REPLACE PROCEDURE</a> statement, which is available with Db2 12 function level 507 and later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/docs/working-with-stored-procedures/creating-external-java-stored-procedures.html">External Java and SQLJ stored procedures</a>, which are stored procedures that are written in Java or SQLJ but that contain SQL statements.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/docs/working-with-stored-procedures/creating-external-sql-stored-procedures.html">External SQL stored procedures</a>, which are stored procedures that are written entirely in SQL and that contain the EXTERNAL option, the FENCED option or both. A C program and an associated package are generated for external SQL stored procedures. Note that external SQL stored procedures are deprecated in Db2 for z/OS.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Information is also provided for working with <a href="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/docs/working-with-stored-procedures/working-with-dbcs-data.html">double-byte character set (DBCS) data</a> and <a href="/Aparna-Ashokan/Db2-developer-extension-staging/docs/working-with-stored-procedures/working-with-user-defined-types.html">user-defined types</a>.</p>
