For example, in the following SELECT statement, SALARY is a column name:\n\nSELECT EMPNO, WORKDEPT FROM DSN8D10.EMP WHERE (BONUS + COMM) &lt; SALARY;\n\n\nBut because Db2 Developer Extension has no way to determine that SALARY is a column name, it interprets it as an input variable and prompts you to assign a value before running the statement.\n\nTo get around this limitation, follow these best practices:\n\n\n  Explicitly qualify table columns:\n\n\nSELECT EMPNO, WORKDEPT FROM DSN8D10.EMP WHERE (BONUS + COMM) &lt; DSN8D10.EMP.SALARY;\n\n\n\n  Use a variable name that doesn’t match a column name:\n\n\n DECLARE VSALARY DECIMAL(9,2);\n\n\nFor more information, see References to SQL parameters and variables."

						"content": "Committing and rolling back changes\n\nDb2 Developer Extension provides a lot of flexibility with committing and rolling back the results of running SQL statements. This granular level of control is especially useful when you’re prototyping and testing because it allows you to identify which statements run successfully and which cause errors without potentially corrupting your test system.\n\nFor example, you can:\n\n\n  Commit the changes for each SQL statement as soon as it completes successfully\n  Commit the changes for all SQL statements only if all the statements run successfully\n  Roll back all of the changes even if all of the statements run successfully\n\n\nDepending on the commit or rollback option you select, you have the following options for what happens when an error occurs while running your SQL:\n\n\n  Continue to process the remaining SQL statements that you selected to run\n  Stop processing as soon as the first error occurs\n  Stop processing and immediately roll back all changes\n\n\nYou set these options by right-clicking in your file and selecting Run SQL Options from the context menu to display the JDBC runtime options view. You use the Action when script runs successfully box to set commit and rollback options, and you use the Action when an error occurs box to control how Db2 Developer Extension responds when a SQL statement fails.\n\nLet’s start with this scenario: Our company has just formed a new Client Support department and has staffed it with some existing employees and some new employees. We need to update two tables with information about the new department and its members. We’ll use a couple of Db2-supplied sample tables, DSN8C10.DEPT and DSN8C10.EMP, to demonstrate how the commit, roll back, and error-handling options work.\n\nHere’s the correct SQL for making these changes:\n\nUPDATE DSN8C10.DEPT SET DEPTNAME = 'CLIENT SUPPORT' WHERE DEPTNO = 'E01';\nINSERT INTO DSN8C10.DEPT VALUES ('A01', 'AI AD TEAM', '000070', 'D01', 'SVL');\nSELECT * FROM DSN8C10.DEPT WHERE DEPTNO = 'A01';\nUPDATE DSN8C10.EMP SET SALARY = SALARY * 1.1 WHERE WORKDEPT = 'A00';\nSELECT * FROM DSN8C10.EMP WHERE WORKDEPT = 'A00';\n\n\nTo help demonstrate the available actions when an error occurs, we’re going to introduce a few errors into this SQL in the following sections.\n\nCommit after each statement\n\nSelect Commit after each statement to commit each individual SQL statement after it runs successfully.\n\n\n\nHere’s the SQL to update the DSN8C10.DEPT and DSN8C10.EMP tables. In this example, the INSERT statement and the second UPDATE and SELECT statements contain errors.\n\nUPDATE DSN8C10.DEPT SET DEPTNAME = 'CLIENT SUPPORT' WHERE DEPTNO = 'E01';\nINSERT INTO DSN8C10.DEPT VALUES (‘A01’, ‘AI AD TEAM’, ‘M001’, ‘D01’);\nSELECT * FROM DSN8C10.DEPT WHERE DEPTNO = 'A01';\nUPDATE DSN8C10.EMP SET SALARY = SALARY * 1.1 WHERE DEPT = 'A00';\nSELECT * FROM DSN8C10.EMP WHERE DEPTNO = 'A00';\n\n\nAnd here are the results from running that SQL, which resulted in three errors:\n\n\n  If you select Processing continues, all of the SQL statements will continue to run after the first error (INSERT INTO DSN8C10.DEPT…) occurred, and the successful UPDATE statement will be committed. The results would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n  If you select Processing stops, all of the SQL statements after the first error will not be not be run, but the successful UPDATE statement will still be committed. The results would look like this instead:\n\n\n\n\n\n  If you correct the three statements that are causing errors so that all of these statements run error free, each statement will be committed as soon as it ran successfully, regardless of the error action that you selected, and the results would look like this:\n\n\n\n\nCommit on completion\n\nSelect Commit on completion to wait until all of the SQL statements that you have selected to run have completed before committing any of them.\n\n\n\nHere’s the SQL to update the DSN8C10.DEPT and DSN8C10.EMP tables, which contains one error in the INSERT statement:\n\nUPDATE DSN8C10.DEPT SET DEPTNAME = 'CLIENT SUPPORT' WHERE DEPTNO = 'E01';\nINSERT INTO DSN8C10.DEPT VALUES  ('A01', 'AI AD TEAM', 'M001, 'D01');\nSELECT * FROM DSN8C10.DEPT WHERE DEPTNO = 'A01';\nUPDATE DSN8C10.EMP SET SALARY = SALARY * 1.1 WHERE WORKDEPT = 'A00';\nSELECT * FROM DSN8C10.EMP WHERE WORKDEPT = 'A00';\n\n\nAnd here are the results from running that SQL, which resulted in a single error:\n\n\n  If you select Processing continues, all the SQL statements that you selected will continue to run after an error occurs, and both UPDATE statements will be committed when processing ends. The results would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n  If you select Processing stops, all of the SQL statements after the first error will not be run. Only the first UPDATE statement will be committed when processing ends. The results would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n  If you select Processing stops and changes are rolled back, all of the SQL statements after the first error will not be run. Changes from the first UPDATE statement will not be committed. The results would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n  If you correct the INSERT statement so all of the SQL statements run error free, each statement would be committed after the last statement ran successfully regardless of the error action that you selected, and the results would look like this:\n\n\n\n\nRoll back changes on completion\n\nSelect Roll back changes on completion if you don’t want to commit any changes that result from running your SQL, even if everything runs error free.\n\n\n\nHere’s the SQL to update the DSN8C10.DEPT and DSN8C10.EMP tables, which contains one error in the INSERT statement:\n\nUPDATE DSN8C10.DEPT SET DEPTNAME = 'CLIENT SUPPORT' WHERE DEPTNO = 'E01';\nINSERT INTO DSN8C10.DEPT VALUES  ('A01', 'AI AD TEAM', 'M001', 'D01');\nSELECT * FROM DSN8C10.DEPT WHERE DEPTNO = 'A01';\nUPDATE DSN8C10.EMP SET SALARY = SALARY * 1.1 WHERE WORKDEPT = 'A00';\nSELECT * FROM DSN8C10.EMP WHERE WORKDEPT = 'A00'\n\n\nAnd here are the results from running that SQL, which resulted in a single error:\n\n\n  If you select Processing continues, all the SQL statements that you selected will continue to run after an error occurs. No changes will be committed. The results would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n  If you select Processing stops and changes are rolled back, all of the SQL statements after the first error will not be run. Changes from the first UPDATE statement are not committed. The results would look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n  If you correct the INSERT statement so all of the SQL statements run error free, no changes will be committed regardless of the error action that was selected, and the results would look like this:"

You can change this name by editing the connection and changing the Connection name field.\n\nConnecting with multi-factor authentication\n\nWhen you select MFA token as the login method, use the IBM Verify app to generate an MFA token and specify that token in the MFA token field.\n\nIf your environment is set up for login using an MFA token only, you can log in without a password by turning the Use MFA without a password toggle on.\n\n\n\nImportant: To reduce timeout issues with MFA tokens, make sure that the following Db2 for z/OS subsystem parameters are set appropriately. For example:\n\nMFA_AUTHCACHE_UNUSED_TIME=120\nAUTHEXIT_CACHEREFRESH=ALL\n\n\nConnecting with SSL/TLS\n\nBefore you can use SSL/TLS to connect to a Db2 server, the Db2 server must be configured for SSL/TLS. If you’re not sure if the Db2 server has been configured for SSL/TLS, check with your network administrator.\n\n\n  Add or edit a Db2 connection.\n  In the General tab, specify the secure port in the Port field.\n  \n    In the Optional tab, specify the JDBC properties for a secure connection.\n\n    At a minimum, you’ll need the following properties:\n\n    \n      sslConnection to true\n      One of the following set of properties to specify the Db2 server certificate location:\n        \n          sslCertLocation\n          sslTrustStoreLocation and sslTrustStorePassword\n          sslTrustStoreLocation, sslTrustStorePassword (optional), and sslTrustStoreType\n        \n      \n    \n\n    If you’re using the Java KeyStore to store the client certificate, you’ll need to add the following properties:\n\n    \n      securityMechanism set to 18\n        \n          One of the following set of properties to specify the client certificate location:\n          sslKeyStoreLocation and sslKeyStorePassword\n          sslKeyStoreLocation and sslKeyStorePassword (optional), and sslKeyStoreType\n        \n      \n    \n\n    The following example shows the properties for using the Java truststore and Java KeyStore.\n\n    \n\n    If you’re using encrypted password security (security mechanism 7) or encrypted user ID and encrypted password security (security mechanism 9), you’ll need one of the following set of properties:\n\n    \n      For encrypted password security, set the securityMechanism property to 7 and set the encryptionAlgorithm property to the appropriate value for your environment.\n      For encrypted user ID and encrypted password security, set the securityMechanism property to 9 and set the encryptionAlgorithm property to the appropriate value for your environment.\n    \n  \n  Click Finish to establish an SSL connection to the Db2 server.\n\n\nFor more information, see Configuring connections under the IBM Data Server Driver for JDBC and SQLJ to use SSL."

For instructions, see Setting up the environment for Java routines.\n\nYou also need SYSADM authority or EXECUTE privilege on the following procedures:\n\n\n  SQLJ.DB2_INSTALL_JAR\n  SQLJ.REMOVE_JAR\n  SQLJ.DB2_REPLACE_JAR\n  SQLJ.ALTER_JAVA_PATH\n  SQLJ.DB2_UPDATEJARINFO (Required only if you want to upload the Java source along with the stored procedure)\n  WLM_REFRESH (Required only if you want to refresh the WLM environment)\n\n\nIf you do need to refresh the WLM environment, you’ll also need to set up the WLM_REFRESH stored procedure. See WLM_REFRESH stored procedure for details.\n\nCreating a basic external Java or SQLJ stored procedure with code snippets\n\nTo create a Java or SQLJ stored procedure, you need the following files:\n\n\n  The Java source file that you want to create a stored procedure for, which you provide.

						"content": "Creating stored procedures\n\nThis article covers the basics of using Db2 Developer Extension to create a simple stored procedure and then explains some of the more complex things you might need to do when you create a stored procedure, such as working with DBCS data and user-defined types.\n\nStored procedures are a powerful tool for increasing the performance and efficiency of distributed applications. Currently, Db2 Developer Extension supports Db2 for z/OS native stored procedures, which are stored procedures that are written entirely in SQL and are created by using the CREATE PROCEDURE or CREATE  OR REPLACE PROCEDURE statement, which is available with Db2 12 function level 507 and later.\n\nCreating a basic stored procedure with code snippets\n\n\n  \n    Open a new .spsql file, and start typing CREATE PROCEDURE. You’ll only need to type a few letters before you see CREATE PROCEDURE in the list of available code snippets.\n  \n  \n    Select that snippet to populate your file with the basic CREATE PROCEDURE structure (in the following example, the procedure name has already been changed to MYPROCEDURE):\n  \n\n\n\n\nThe snippet includes some of the more commonly used parameters and an example SELECT statement. The SELECT statement is the part of the stored procedure that gets executed when the stored procedure is called. To see all of the options that you can define in a stored procedure, open the link that is included at the top of the snippet.\n\nNow this stored procedure is ready to be deployed. To learn how, see Deploying, running, and debugging stored procedures.\n\nNow let’s look at some more complex examples.\n\nWorking with double-byte character set (DBCS) data\n\nLanguages such as Chinese and Japanese contain double-byte characters, which are characters that are too large to represent with a single byte.  If you write SQL applications that support double-byte character languages, you need to know a bit about how Db2 for z/OS supports DBCS data and how character translation is handled.  This section describes how to code DBCS data in a Db2 for z/OS native stored procedure.\n\nDb2 for z/OS provides DBCS support for the following data types:\n\n\n  \n    GRAPHIC: A fixed-length data type that’s used to store a graphic string.\n  \n  \n    VARGRAPHIC: A varying-length data type used to store a variable-length graphic string.\n  \n  \n    CHAR or CLOB defined with “FOR MIXED DATA”: Data types that are used to store character data or mixed data (that is, a combination of single-byte character set (SBCS) characters and multi-byte character set (MBCS) characters).”\n  \n  \n    DBCLOB: A double-byte character large object.\n  \n\n\nTip: Db2 translates all Db2 character data between the internal Db2 table Code Character Set Identifier (CCSID) and the external application CCSID.\n\nThe following example shows a user-defined type stored procedure that includes a double-byte DBCLOB variable. When you create a stored procedure that includes DBCLOB parameters, you need to specify PARAMETER CCSID UNICODE, and if the stored procedure includes DBCLOBs in the body, you need to specify APPLICATION ENCODING SCHEMA UNICODE.\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE ADMF001.TEST_DBCLOB (\n  IN VAR1 DBCLOB,\n  INOUT VAR2 DBCLOB,\n  OUT VAR3 DBCLOB\n  )\n  APPLICATION ENCODING SCHEME UNICODE\n  PARAMETER CCSID UNICODE\n  VERSION V1\n  ISOLATION LEVEL CS\n  LANGUAGE SQL\n  BEGIN\n    SET VAR2 = '你好';\n    SET VAR3 = VAR1;\n  END\n\n\nSetting this input returns the following output:\n\nVAR1  IN: HELLOWORLD\nVAR2 OUT: 你好\nVAR3 OUT: HELLOWORLD\n\n\nWorking with user-defined types: Distinct\n\nYou can create and use a custom data type that’s called a user-defined distinct type in Db2 for z/OS. For example, let’s say that you keep email documents that are sent to your company in a Db2 table. The Db2 data type of an email document is a CLOB, but you define it as a distinct type so that you can control the types of operations that are performed on the email data. The distinct type is defined like this:\n\nCREATE DISTINCT TYPE E_MAIL AS CLOB(5M); \n\n\nNow you can define and write a native stored procedure or user-defined function to search for and return the following information about an email document:\n\n\n  Subject\n  Sender\n  Date sent\n  Message content\n  Indicator of whether the document contains a user-specified string.\n\n\nThe following example shows how to create a user-defined distinct type for a currency (US_DOLLAR), how to include it in a stored procedure, and how to do some calculations.\n\nNote that the US_DOLLAR distinct type does not automatically inherit the functions and operators of its source type, DECIMAL. You can use casting functions to assign values other than host variables. Also, the DISTINCT keyword is optional.\n\nCREATE DISTINCT TYPE US_DOLLAR AS DECIMAL(9,2);\nCREATE TYPE EURO AS DECIMAL(9,2);\n \nCREATE PROCEDURE ADMF001.SALESSUM (\n   IN DOLLAR_AMOUNT US_DOLLAR,\n   IN EURO_AMOUNT EURO,\n   OUT TOTAL_DOLLAR US_DOLLAR,\n   OUT TOTAL_EURO EURO\n  )\n  LANGUAGE SQL\n  VERSION V1\n  ISOLATION LEVEL CS \n  BEGIN\n    SET TOTAL_DOLLAR = DECIMAL(DOLLAR_AMOUNT)*200;\n    SET TOTAL_EURO = DECIMAL(EURO_AMOUNT)+300.07;\n  END\n\n\nSetting this input returns the following output:\n\nDOLLAR_AMOUNT  IN: 34.50\nEURO_AMOUNT    IN: 500\nTOTAL_DOLLAR  OUT: 6900.00\nTOTAL_DOLLAR  OUT: 30507.00\n\n\nWorking with user-defined types: Arrays\n\nAn array value is a structure that contains an ordered collection of elements. Arrays make it easier to exchange long lists of values with the Db2 server. You can create a user-defined data type for an array in Db2 for z/OS.\n\nThe following example shows how to create an ordinary array user-defined type (PHONENUMBERS) that can contain a maximum of 50 elements. The elements are of the DECIMAL(10,0) data type. The array index starts with 1.\n\nCREATE TYPE PHONENUMBERS AS DECIMAL(10,0) ARRAY[50];\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE ADMF001.TESTPROC(\n   IN PHONENUMBER PHONENUMBERS,\n   OUT outPHONENUMBER PHONENUMBERS\n  )\n  LANGUAGE SQL\n  VERSION V1\n  ISOLATION LEVEL CS\n  BEGIN\n    SET outPHONENUMBER[1]= PHONENUMBER[1];\n  END\n\n\nSetting this input returns the following output:\n\nPHONENUMBER      IN: [6262158888;4056789999]\noutPHONENUMBER  OUT: [6262158888]\n\n\nThe following example shows how to create an ordinary arrays user-defined type for time and timestamp with time zone. The default TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE length is 6.\n\nCREATE TYPE TIMEARRAY AS TIME ARRAY[];\nCREATE TYPE TIMESTAMPARRAY AS TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE ARRAY[];\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE ADMF001.TESTPROC (\n  IN inTIME TIMEARRAY,\n  IN inTIMESTAMPWITHZONE TIMESTAMPARRAY\n  OUT outTIME TIME\n  OUT outTIMESTAPWITHZONE TIMESTAMPARRAY\n    )\n  LANGUAGE SQL\n  VERSION V1\n  ISOLATION LEVEL CS\n  BEGIN\n    SET outTIME = INTIME[1];\n    SET outTIMESTAMPWITHZONE[1] = inTIMESTAMPWITHZONE[1];\n  END\n\n\nSetting this input returns the following output:\n\ninTIME               IN: [08:09:01;10:15:00;11:08:30]\ninTIMESTAMPWITHZONE  IN: [2020-10-15 15:01:01.111213141516+4:00]\noutTIME             OUT: 08:09:01\noutTIMESTAPWITHZONE OUT: [2020-10-15 15:01:01.111213]"

See Deploying and running external Java and SQLJ stored procedures for more information.\n  \n  \n    Debugging Java and SQLJ stored procedures requires the Debugger for Java extension, which is included with the \nExtension Pack for Java. If this extension is not already part of your VS Code environment, follow these instructions to install it from within VS Code.\n  \n\n\nProcedure\n\nTo debug an external Java or SQLJ stored procedure:\n\n\n  \n    Open your .java or .sqlj source file and set the breakpoints for where you want the debugger to pause execution.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Open the .javaspsql or .spsql file that contains the DDL of the Java or SQLJ stored procedure and click the  Debug Stored Procedure icon.\n\n    \n\n    The file that you are debugging opens in the Debug view and debug processing begins.\n\n    \n\n    When the debugging process starts, the following toolbar is displayed at the top of the view:\n\n    \n\n    You use this toolbar to step through your code. From left to right, these actions are:\n\n    \n      \n        Continue execution of the program until it hits a breakpoint, encounters an error, or completes\n      \n      \n        Step Over to the next line of the program in the same code level\n      \n      \n        Step Into the program to enter a deeper code level if the current line is a method\n      \n      \n        Step Out to the caller if the current code level is inside a method\n      \n      \n        Restart the debugging program\n      \n      \n        Stop the debugging program\n      \n    \n\n    The Debug view also displays the following sections in the Primary side bar:\n\n    \n      \n        The Variables section contains variables declared through program execution and keeps track of the defined value of each variable as the debugger works its way through the code.\n      \n      \n        Use the Watch section to specify variables or expressions that you want to be evaluated by the debugger.\n      \n      \n        The Call stack section keeps track of the current code level during debugger execution.\n      \n      \n        The Breakpoints section keeps track of the breakpoints set throughout the code module.\n      \n    \n\n    For more information about debugging your code in Visual Studio Code, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging.\n\n    When debugging is complete, the results view will display the final results of the execution of the stored procedure.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nKnown issues\n\n\n  For SQLJ stored procedures, inner classes and their methods cannot be stepped into. This behavior is consistent with the debugging capabilities of Data Studio.\n  For SQLJ stored procedures, using functions in SQL statements prevents breakpoints from being verified in Debugger for Java and results in breakpoints being ignored.*\n  Duplicate class names in different directories can cause the debugger to select the wrong class file for debugging.*\n\n\n* This is a Debugger for Java issue and is not unique to Db2 Developer Extension."

See Debugging stored procedures by using the Unified Debugger for instructions.\n  \n  \n    For UDFs, only compiled scalar UDFs that include the VERSION parameter are eligible for debugging.\n  \n  \n    When you deploy a routine, you must set the Enable debugging option to On.\n  \n\n\nDebugging a routine\n\nThe Debug action allows you to debug your routine by using the native IDE debugger. You can set breakpoints in the editor, and you can watch values change over time in the debug environment. Setting conditional breakpoints is covered later in this topic.\n\nYou can also specify additional debugging options by using the Run SQL Options dialog. If input variables are specified in the SQL, you’ll be prompted to specify values for them before the SQL goes through debugging.\n\nNote: If you are using multi-factor authentication, you will be prompted to enter an MFA token twice: when you first connect to Db2 and again when you initiate the debugging process. Use the IBM Verify app to generate these MFA tokens. You can eliminate the need to generate a new token for the second request if the MFA_AUTHCACHE_UNUSED_TIME and AUTHEXIT_CACHEREFRESH=ALL Db2 subsystem parameters are set appropriately.\n\nClick the Debug action to start debugging process. If your routine contains input variables, you’ll be prompted to specify values for them before the SQL goes through debugging, as shown in the following figure. Note that built-in data types for each input variable are detected automatically and are set to the correct data type.\n\n\n\nAfter you specify input parameter values, click Debug. Set the breakpoints for where you want the debugger to pause execution:\n\n\n\nWhen the debugging process starts, the following toolbar is displayed at the top of the view:\n\n\n\nYou use this toolbar to step through your code. From left to right, these actions are:\n\n\n  \n    Continue execution of the program until it hits a breakpoint, encounters an error, or completes\n  \n  \n    Step Over to the next line of the program in the same code level\n  \n  \n    Step Into the program to enter a deeper code level if the current line is a method\n  \n  \n    Step Out to the caller if the current code level is inside a method\n  \n  \n    Restart the debugging program\n  \n  \n    Stop the debugging program\n  \n\n\nClick the Run and Debug icon in the Activity Bar () to display the following sections:\n\n\n  \n    The Variables section contains variables declared through program execution and keeps track of the defined value of each variable as the debugger works its way through the code.\n  \n  \n    Use the Watch section to specify variables or expressions that you want to be evaluated by the debugger.\n  \n  \n    The Call stack section keeps track of the current code level during debugger execution.\n  \n  \n    The Breakpoints section keeps track of the breakpoints set throughout the code module.\n  \n\n\nFor more information about debugging your code in Visual Studio Code, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging.\n\nSetting conditional hit-count breakpoints\n\nYou can specify a hit count when you define a breakpoint, which means that when the breakpoint is reached, instead of pausing, execution continues until the hit count that you specified is reached. This feature is useful when you debug routines that contain loops. You can allow execution to continue for the specified number of loops, and then debug the code when that number is reached.\n\nTo set a breakpoint that includes a hit count:\n\n\n  For a routine that has already been deployed, right-click and select Debug Routine.\n  Set any input parameters that need to be set.\n  Click Debug. A .spsql or .udfsql file opens and the debugger starts at the top of this file.\n  Click the line that you want to set the conditional breakpoint for, then right-click and select Edit Breakpoint &gt; Add Conditional Breakpoint &gt; Hit Count. (Note that in this release, the Expression and Log Message options are not supported.)\n  Specify the number of times the loop should be run before the debugger pauses.\n  Click Continue () to proceed with debugging.\n\n\n\n\nThe breakpoints that you set persist on the file. You don’t need to reset these breakpoints if you want to debug this file again.\n\nYou can clear breakpoints by deselecting them in the BREAKPOINTS view or by clicking on and removing them individually from the file.\n\nAfter you’re familiar with the basic debugging process, check out Advanced techniques for debugging native and external SQL stored procedures."

						"content": "Advanced techniques for debugging native and external SQL stored procedures and user-defined functions\n\nAfter you understand the basic process of debugging native and external SQL stored procedures and user-defined functions (UDFs), you might need some more in-depth information about using Db2 Developer Extension to debug more complex problems.\n\nNote: Although the examples and screens in this topic show a stored procedure, the process of debugging a UDF is identical.\n\nFor example, many stored procedures contain extremely complex business logic, especially when nested stored procedures are involved. In these types of stored procedures, locating, analyzing, and fixing a problem can be quite a challenge. \n\nThis article uses two example stored procedures to show you how to step through nested stored procedures, set breakpoints, and modify stored procedure variable values at runtime.\n\nThe first example stored procedure is RETURNBESTDEPTINFO, shown in the following figure. This is the caller stored procedure. It will retrieve the list of department names from the WORKDEPT column of the DSN8D10.EMP sample table. \n\n\n\nThen, the RETURNBESTDEPTINFO caller stored procedure will pass each department name in this list to the callee stored procedure, RETURNDEPTSALARY (shown in the following figure), in a loop to get the total salary and bonus count of that department. Within the loop, the caller stored procedure will continue to compare the bonus count between each department to determine the department with the highest bonus and return this information to the user.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the caller stored procedure isn’t working as expected. It always returns blank output values, as shown in the following figure. We need to determine if the code bug is in the caller stored procedure or in the callee stored procedure.\n\n\n\nOur first step in debugging these nested stored procedures is to deploy them with ENABLE DEBUGGING turned on. We also need to specify the WLM environment name for debugging.\n\nAfter the stored procedures are deployed correctly, we start to debug them by clicking Debug Routinee.  When the execution cursor is displayed on the first line of the RETURNBESTDEPTINFO caller stored procedure, we set a breakpoint on the line of code that calls the RETURNDEPTSALARY callee stored procedure. Then we either click Continue or we press F5 to continue the execution. When the execution cursor reaches that breakpoint (line 22 in the following figure), execution pauses.\n\n\n\nNow we either click Step Into or we press F11, which causes the execution cursor to switch to the RETURNDEPTSALARY callee stored procedure. From within the callee stored procedure, we can check if the variable values are assigned correctly by setting another breakpoint at the end of the callee stored procedure and then clicking Continue to resume execution until that breakpoint is reached, as shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\nFrom the CALL STACK view on the left in the previous figure, we can see that we have a call stack structure of two stack frames. The upper one is the the RETURNBESTDEPTINFO caller stored procedure, and the lower one is the RETURNDEPTSALARY callee stored procedure.\n\nFrom the VARIABLES view, shown in the following figure, we can see that all the variable values have been assigned correctly for department A00. Department A00 has a total salary of 208350.00 and a bonus count of 5, which will be returned to RETURNBESTDEPTINFO for further comparison.\n\nNow let’s click Step Out or press Shift+F11 to return to the RETURNBESTDEPTINFO caller stored procedure. We can see that the CALL STACK view shows only the information of the current stack frame of RETURNBESTDEPTINFO and that the VARIABLES view shows that the information from department A00 has been returned correctly to the caller.\n\n\n\nUntil now, we might have suspected that the RETURNBESTDEPTINFO stored procedure contains the code bug. A conditional comparison between two variables might provide us with some additional clues. In the stored procedure, we check if DEPTBONUSCNT is greater than OUT_DEPTBONUSCNT. Let’s add these two variables to the WATCH view to see their values.\n\nTo add these variables to the WATCH view, double-click on the target variable, right-click it, then select the Add to Watch menu item:\n\n\n\nWith the two variables added to the WATCH view, as shown in the following figure, after the execution of the IF block completes, we can see that no value is defined for the OUT_DEPTBONUSCNT variable. Because we are comparing OUT_DEPTBONUSCNT with DEPTBONUSCNT, which has an integer value of 5, OUT_DEPBONUSCNT should also have an integer value defined.\n\n\n\nWe can manually modify the runtime value of the OUT_DEPTBONUSCNT variable in the debug session by double-clicking the value field of this variable in the VARIABLES view. Now we assign it an integer value of 0 for testing. Notice that the value in the WATCH view has been updated to 0.\n\n\n\nLet’s resume the execution to see if the code runs with this modification.\n\n\n\nNow, all the output variables have been assigned correct values. For now, they’re for department B01. Let’s remove the breakpoint in the loop (it will cause the execution to take longer) and let the stored procedure execute to the end.   \n\nGreat! The stored procedures are working as designed and are now returning correct values.\n\n\n\nBy using Db2 Developer Extension’s stored procedure debugger, we were able to quickly determine that a variable initialization was missing for the OUT_DEPTBONUSCNT variable. Without the stored procedure debugger, to locate a code bug in a stored procedure, we would need to update the stored procedure to print more trace data or generate more logs, we would need to execute the stored procedure multiple times to collect the data, and then we would need to to analyze that data, all of which takes a huge amount of time. With the stored procedure debugger, we can develop and maintain stored procedures more quickly and with higher efficiency.\n\nMore tips on debugging native and external SQL stored procedures and user-defined functions\n\nThe following sections contain more information about the process of debugging stored procedures and UDFs with Db2 Developer Extension.\n\nRequired privileges\n\nMake sure that you have the privilege to perform SELECT operations on the SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES Db2 subsystem catalog table. Before you can debug on Db2 for z/OS, you must run the DSNTIJSD job in the prefix.SDSNSAMP data set to set up the environment.\n\nReloading historical breakpoints\n\nWhen breakpoints have been set and not removed during a debugging session, the breakpoints will be loaded automatically the next time you debug the same stored procedure.\n\nError codes and exception handling\n\nWhen you launch the stored procedure debugger, you might see the following error codes and messages that warn you of various situations that might prevent the debugger from operating properly. Corrective actions are provided with each error code.\n\n\n\n-9900 = The Session Manager could not be started.\n-9901 = The specified port number is not valid.\n-9906 = The specified port is not available.\n\nVerify that the port number assigned for Debug Session Manager is available and has not been assigned to other applications.\n\n\n\n-9904 = The stored procedure DBG_PINGSESSIONMANAGER could not be started on the server.\n\nThis stored procedure is created during Db2 subsystem installation and is invoked to check the connection between the debug client and server. If it is not working, contact your system administrator.\n\n\n\n-9905 = The Session Manager could not be reached by a ping from the server.\n\nA valid connection has been lost between your client and the Db2 server. Attempt to reconnect.\n\n\n\n-9908 = The routine is not enabled for debugging.\n\nEither add the ALLOW DEBUG MODE and WLM ENVIRONMENT FOR DEBUG MODE wlm_name  clause to the CREATE STORED PROCEDURE statement, or turn on the Enable debugging option of Routine options and set the WLM environment when you deploy the stored procedure that you want to debug.\n\n\n\n-9910 = The JCC driver could not be loaded.\n\nThe JDBC connection cannot be established between client and Db2 server.\n\n\n\n-440 = The debugging routines were not found.\n\nThe stored procedure that is being debugged has not been deployed on the Db2 server yet. Check the stored procedure name, schema, and path setting.\n\n\n\nTo obtain detailed information about errors that occurred with the extension:\n\n  Turn on extension logging by setting Db2forzosdeveloperextension &gt; Debug : Log Level to be any value other than ‘off’.\n  Issue the ‘open extension logs folder’ command in the Command Palette to display the log files folder."

						"content": "Deploying multiple routines simultaneously\n\nWhen you are developing a Db2 for z/OS application, you might want to create and deploy many stored procedures or user-defined functions (UDFs) for your application. The following instructions describe how to deploy multiple routines in a single operation.\n\n\n  \n    Select the routines that you want to deploy. Only files that have an extension of .spsql, .javaspsql, or .udfsql are supported.\n\n    \n      Select multiple individual stored procedure or UDF files, one or more folders that contain stored procedure or UDF files, or a combination of files and folders. Then right-click and select Deploy Routines from the context menu.\n      Select all of the routines in your workspace by clicking the Deploy icon ().\n    \n\n    The Deployment options tab opens and the routines that you selected are parsed to ensure that they’re valid.\n  \n  \n    Specify the appropriate deployment options for your routines.\n\n    \n\n    \n      Use the Db2 connection option to select a connection from the list of defined connections. See Creating a database connection for more information.  Note that when you deploy multiple rotuines simultaneously, the Db2 connection information that you specify is not saved in the UI.\n\n      Use the Target schema option for unqualified routines. If you leave this field empty, the currentSchema JDBC property will be used if it has been set. If currentSchema is not set, the JDBC connection username will be used.\n      Use the Build owner option to specify the owner of the routine. If you leave this field empty, the currentSQLID JDBC property will be used if it has been set. If currentSQLID is not set, the JDBC connection username will be used.\n      \n        Use the Default path option for resolving an unqualified data type, function, or procedure referenced by the routine that is being deployed. You can specify multiple schemas, each one separated by a comma. For example:\n\n        \"ADMF002\",\"ADMF003\",\"ADMF004\"\n        \n      \n      \n        Use the Duplicate handling option to specify the behavior of the deployment when a routine with the same name in the same schema already exists. The options that are available depend on the types of routines that you are deploying:\n\n        \n          Alter duplicate native stored procedures and non-inline UDFs applies to situations in which you have a combination of routines. Depending on the type of routine, this option alters an existing routine, or drops an existing routine and creates the routine.\n          Drop duplicates drops the existing duplicate routine during deployment and creates a new routine.\n          Treat duplicate deployments as errors returns an error if the routine already exists. If other versions of the routine do not exist, the routine is created.\n        \n      \n      \n        Use the Error handling option to specify the behavior of the deployment when a deployment for a routine fails. The following options are:\n\n        \n          Ignore errors and continue to the next routine will continue to deploy the following routines after the first deployment error.\n          Stop on errors causes the following routines after the first deployment error, to not be deployed.\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Click the Other options tab to specify additional deployment parameters. A list of the routines that you selected is displayed alongside additional deployment options. The tabs that are displayed will vary depending on the type of routine that you are working with:\n\n    \n      For native stored procedures and non-inline UDFs, only the Routine options tab is displayed.\n      For external SQL stored procedures, the Routine options tab and the External SQL options tabs are displayed.\n      For Java and SQLJ stored procedures, the Routine options tab and the Java options tabs are displayed.\n      For UDFs, there are currently no additional deployment options.\n    \n\n    Routine options\n\n    \n\n    \n      Use the Enable debugging option to specify whether the routines are available to be debugged.\n      Use the WLM environment option to specify which Workload Manager environment will be used to debug the routines. If you enable debugging but leave this field empty, the default WLM environment will be used.\n      Use the ASU time limit option to set the ASUTIME, which is the number of CPU seconds permitted for each SQL statement. The default value of 0 means NO LIMIT and is not recommended.\n      \n        Use the Additional routine options field to specify any additional options that you want to include. Separate each option with a semicolon. For example:\n\n        QUALIFIER ADMF002; ISOLATION LEVEL RS\n        \n      \n    \n\n    External SQL options\n\n    \n    \n      The Build utility field identifies the Db2 SQL procedure processor, SYSPROC.DSNTPSMP, which is used to create an external SQL stored procedure.\n      Use the Precompile options option to specify options for precompiling the C language program that Db2 generates for the external SQL procedure. Do not specify the HOST option. For a list of these options see SQL processing options.\n      Use the Compile options option to specify options for compiling the C language program that Db2 generates for the external SQL procedure.\n      Use the Prelink options option to specify options for prelinking the C language program that Db2 generates for the external SQL procedure.\n      Use the Link options option to specify options for linking the C language program that Db2 generates for the external SQL procedure.\n      Use the Bind options option to specify options for binding the external SQL procedure package. Do not specify the MEMBER or LIBRARY option for the Db2 BIND PACKAGE command. For a list of these options, see BIND and REBIND options.\n    \n\n    Java options\n\n    \n    \n      Use the Java file path option to specify the Java class file. It must have a public static void method, which works as an entry point for the stored procedure. The class name, declared package, and method name should match the external name defined in the CREATE PROCEDURE statement. If the Java class declares a package path, its location must match the package path to be able to compile properly.\n      \n        Use the Java dependencies option to specify any compilation and runtime dependencies that are required by the Java class. Dependent JARs are defined to Db2 if you select Upload; otherwise, dependent JARs are used only for compilation. Dependent JARs must be defined in the Java path on the server unless they have been defined already to Db2 by other Java stored procedures.\n\n        Requirement: If a dependent JAR file has its own dependent JAR files, save this JAR file and all its dependent JAR files on the server and add them to your JAVA path on the server. When you deploy this stored procedure, uncheck the Upload option for this JAR file and its dependent JAR files.\n      \n      Use the Compatible JRE version option to specify a JRE that is at the same level or lower than the JRE version that is on Db2 for z/OS database. If the specified JRE version is higher than the version on the database, the stored procedure will not run.\n      Select Upload source to the database field to include the associated Java source file when you deploy the stored procedure. If this option is not selected, you can run the stored procedure, but you will not be able to view the source for the stored procedure.\n      Select Refresh Java WLM environment to ensure that the most current version of the stored procedure is run.\n    \n\n    If you don’t specify a required value or specify an invalid value, click on the error icon to troubleshoot the problem:\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Optional: Propagate the same Routine options settings and External SQL options settings for multiple routines by using the following actions:\n\n    \n      \n        Apply settings to all is available when you highlight a folder in the list of selected routines. You can specify options at the folder level and click Apply settings to all to propagate those options to every routine file in the folder.\n      \n      \n        Apply folder settings is available when you highlight an individual routine in the list of routines.  Click Apply folder settings to propagate the options settings that you specified to the folder to only this routine.\n      \n    \n\n    The options that are propagated depend on the type of routine:\n\n    \n      For native stored procedures, Java, and non-inline UDFs, these actions propagate the Routine options only.\n      For external stored procedures, these actions propagate both the Routine options and the External options.\n    \n\n    When you have correctly specified all the required options for all the selected routines, the Deploy button is enabled.\n  \n  \n    Click Deploy to start the deployment process. The Deployment results view is displayed, which provides the status and results for each routine:\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Expand a routine to see details about its results.

						"content": "Deploying and running external Java and SQLJ stored procedures\n\nThis article shows you how to use Db2 Developer Extension to deploy an external Java or SQLJ stored procedure with various deployment options: altering previous deployments, setting target schema, and others. It also walks you through the process of running an external Java or SQLJ stored procedure.\n\nTip: If you’re new to stored procedures, make sure you’re familiar with the information in Creating external Java stored procedures first.\n\nOne big advantage of using Db2 Developer Extension to deploy a stored procedure, as opposed to manually executing SQL, is that you can save the various deployment options separately from the SQL itself, which means that you can push your code into a source code manager, such as GitHub, without having to remove the deployment debug options first.\n\nAnother advantage is that you don’t need to specify --#SET TERMINATOR in the header of .spsql or .javaspsql files. Db2 Developer Extension uses the number sign character (#) as the default terminator character, but you can use any terminator character you want by setting a SQL routine option (explained later in this article).\n\nNote: Currently, Db2 Developer Extension deploy and run options support only one stored procedure per .spsql or .javaspsql file. When stored procedure options are specified, only the first stored procedure in the file will be executed; additional stored procedures and SQL statements will be ignored.\n\nWe’ll use the following example stored procedure throughout this article to demonstrate how to deploy and run an external Java stored procedure. This stored procedure will read the total salary, including bonuses, from the table SYSADM.EMP from a passed in-parameter DEPTNUMBER. You can paste it into a file so that you try things out for yourself.\n\nNote: Although the example is a Java stored procedure, the deployment process is the essentially same for a SQLJ stored procedure. Any differences between the two formats are noted in the instructions.\n\nTotalSalaryJavaSP.spsql\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE MYAPPS.TotalSalaryJavaSP(IN DEPTNUMBER CHAR(3),\n  OUT DEPTSALARY DECIMAL(15,2),\n  OUT DEPTBONUSCNT INT)\n    LANGUAGE JAVA\n    EXTERNAL NAME 'MYAPPS.TotalSalaryJavaSP:TotalSalary.getDeptSalary'\n    PARAMETER STYLE JAVA\n    WLM ENVIRONMENT WLMJAVA\n    READS SQL DATA\n\nAnd here is the example Java code that includes the SQL SELECT statement:\n\nTotalSalary.java\n\nimport java.math.BigDecimal;\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.DriverManager;\nimport java.sql.ResultSet;\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.sql.Statement;\n\n/**\n * A sample JDBC Java stored procedure that returns a result set.\n */\npublic class TotalSalary {\n    public static void getDeptSalary(String DEPTNUMBER, BigDecimal[] DEPTSALARY, int[] DEPTBONUSCNT) throws SQLException {\n        Connection conn = null;\n        Statement stmt = null;\n        String query = \"SELECT SALARY, BONUS FROM SYSADM.EMP WHERE WORKDEPT = '\" + DEPTNUMBER + \"'\";\n        BigDecimal totalSalary = new BigDecimal(0);\n        int bonusCount = 0;\n        try {\n            conn = DriverManager.getConnection(\"jdbc:default:connection\");\n            stmt = conn.createStatement();\n            ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);\n            while (rs.next()) {\n                BigDecimal bonus = rs.getBigDecimal(2);\n                totalSalary = totalSalary.add(rs.getBigDecimal(1)).add(bonus);\n                if (bonus.doubleValue() &gt; 0)\n                    bonusCount++;\n            }\n            DEPTSALARY[0] = totalSalary;\n            DEPTBONUSCNT[0] = bonusCount;\n        } catch (SQLException e) {\n            throw e;\n        } finally {\n            if (null != stmt)\n                stmt.close();\n            if (null != conn)\n                conn.close();\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe file extension of .spsql identifies it as a stored procedure. When you open a .spsql or .javaspsql file in Db2 Developer Extension, you get some additional actions in the toolbar in the upper right corner of the view:\n\n\n\nFrom left to right, these actions are Deploy, Debug, and Run. We’ll cover deploying and running in the following sections.\n\nDeploying a stored procedure\n\nYou can deploy a stored procedure by using any of the following methods:\n\n\n  From within the .spsql or .javaspsql file by clicking Deploy stored procedure from the context menu or the Deployment icon\n  From within the catalog navigation view by clicking Deploy from the overflow menu\n\n\nThe Deployment view is where you can set and customize deployment options and save the options for the .spsql file or .javaspsql file. These options are used only during deployment and do not impact the DDL source code.\n\nThe Deployment view consists of three sections: Deployment options, Java options, and Routine options.\n\nDeployment options\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Db2 connection option to select a connection from the list of defined connections. See Creating a database connection for more information.\n  \n  \n    Use the Target schema option for unqualified stored procedures. This field is enabled only for unqualified stored procedures. If the stored procedure is qualified (like the one in our example CREATE PROCEDURE statement, which is qualified to MYAPPS), the field is disabled. If you leave this field empty, the JDBC property currentSchema will be used. If currentSchema is not set, the JDBC connection username will be used.\n  \n  \n    Use the Build owner option to specify the owner of the stored procedure. If this field is left empty, the JDBC property currentSQLID will be used. If currentSQLID is not set, the JDBC connection username will be used.\n  \n  \n    Use the Default path option for resolving an unqualified data type, function, or procedure referenced by the procedure that’s being deployed. You can specify multiple schemas, each one separated by a comma. For example:\n  \n\n\n    \"ADMF002\",\"ADMF003\",\"ADMF004\"\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Duplicate handling option to specify the behavior of the deployment if the procedure already exists:\n\n    \n      \n        Drop duplicates calls DROP PROCEDURE before running the CREATE PROCEDURE DDL if the procedure already exists and creates the procedure.\n      \n      \n        Treat duplicate deployments as errors returns an error if the procedure already exists. If other versions of the procedure do not already exist, the procedure is created.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nNote: Not all options mentioned above are displayed due to screen size limit.\n\nIf you’re new to SQL and want more information about embedding SQL in host languages, there’s a lot of information about this topic in the Db2 for z/OS documentation.\n\nJava options\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Java file path option to specify the Java or SQLJ source file. It must have a public static void method, which works as an entry point for the stored procedure. The class name, declared package, and method name should match the external name defined in the CREATE PROCEDURE statement. If the Java class declares a package path, its location must match the package path to be able to compile properly.\n  \n  \n    Use the Java dependencies option to specify any compilation and runtime dependencies that are required by the Java class. Dependent JARs are defined to Db2 if you select Upload; otherwise, dependent JARs are used only for compilation. Dependent JARs must be defined in the Java path on the server unless they’ve been defined already to Db2 by other Java stored procedures.\n  \n\n\nRequirement: If a dependent JAR file has its own dependent JAR files, save this JAR file and all its dependent JAR files on the server and add them to your JAVA path on the server. When you deploy this stored procedure, uncheck the Upload option for this JAR file and its dependent JAR files.\n\n\n  \n    Use the Compatible JRE version option to specify a JRE that is at the same level or lower than the JRE version that is on Db2 for z/OS database. If the specified JRE version is higher than the version on the database, the stored procedure will not run.\n  \n  \n    Select Upload source to the database field to include the associated Java source file when you deploy the stored procedure. If this option is not selected, you can run the stored procedure, but you will not be able to view the source for the stored procedure.\n  \n  \n    Click Refresh Java WLM environment to ensure that the most current version of the stored procedure is run.\n  \n\n\nRoutine options\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Enable debugging option to specify whether this procedure is available to be debugged.\n  \n  \n    Use the WLM environment option to specify which Workload Manager environment will be used to debug the procedure. If you enable debugging but leave this field empty, the default WLM environment will used.\n  \n  \n    Use the Additional routine options field to specify any additional options that you want to include. Separate each option with a semicolon. For example:\n  \n\n\n   QUALIFIER ADMF002; ISOLATION LEVEL RS\n\n\n\n  For SQLJ stored procedures only, use the Bind options field to specify options for binding the external SQLJ procedure package. Do not specify the MEMBER or LIBRARY option for the Db2 BIND PACKAGE command. For a list of these options, see BIND and REBIND options.\n\n\nRunning a stored procedure\n\nYou can run a stored procedure by using any of the following methods:\n\n\n  From within the catalog navigation view by clicking Run from the overflow menu\n  From within a .spsql file by clicking Run stored procedure from the context menu or the Run stored procedure icon\n  From the SQL editor either by clicking Run All or highlighting part of the file and clicking Run Selected SQL\n\n\nIf your stored procedure contains input variables, you’ll be prompted to specify values for them before the stored procedure executes, as shown in the following figure. Note that built-in data types for each input variable are detected automatically and are set to the correct data type.\n\nIf you have an input type that’s an array, you’d specify the values like this:\n\nnumeric:   [1; 2; 3]\ncharacter: [hello; world]\n\n\nNote: Arrays are not supported when you run a stored procedure from the SQL editor.\n\nIf your statement contains host variables or positional parameters, you’ll be prompted to specify values for input variables and parameters.\n\n\n\nAfter your stored procedure is executed, the following output is displayed in these tabs:\n\n\n  The Status tab contains overall execution status. If an error occurred, the status will contain SQL code, SQL state, and Message text.\n\n\n\n\n\n  The Parameters tab contains variable information for passed-in parameters.\n\n\n\n\n\n  The SQL Results view contains data if a result set is expected (in our example, a result set isn’t expected so the Result tab isn’t shown)."

When you open a .spsql file in Db2 Developer Extension, you get some additional actions in the toolbar in the upper right corner of the view:\n\nFrom left to right, these actions are Deploy, Debug, and Run. We’ll cover each one in the following sections.\n\n\n\nDeploying a stored procedure\n\nYou can deploy a stored procedure by using any of the following methods:\n\n\n  From within the .spsql file by clicking Deploy stored procedure from the context menu or the Deployment icon\n  From within the catalog navigation view by clicking Deploy from the overflow menu\n\n\nThe Deployment view is where you can set and customize deployment options and save the options for the .spsql file. These options are used only during deployment and do not impact the DDL source code.\n\nThe Deployment view consists of three sections: Deployment options, Routine options, and External options.\n\nDeployment options\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Database connection option to select a connection from the list of defined connections. See Creating a database connection for more information.\n  \n  \n    Use the Target schema option for unqualified stored procedures. This field is enabled only for unqualified stored procedures. If the stored procedure is qualified (lsuch as the one in our example CREATE PROCEDURE statement, which is qualified to ADMF001), the field is disabled. If you leave this field empty, the JDBC property currentSchema will be used. If currentSchema is not set, the JDBC connection username will be used.\n  \n  \n    Use the Build owner option to specify the owner of the stored procedure. If this field is left empty, the JDBC property currentSQLID will be used. If currentSQLID is not set, the JDBC connection username will be used.\n  \n  \n    Use the Default path option for resolving an unqualified data type, function, or procedure referenced by the procedure that’s being deployed. You can specify multiple schemas, each one separated by a comma. For example:\n  \n\n\n    \"ADMF002\",\"ADMF003\",\"ADMF004\"\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Duplicate handling option to specify the behavior of the deployment if the procedure already exists:\n\n    \n      \n        Drop duplicates calls DROP PROCEDURE before running the CREATE PROCEDURE DDL if the procedure already exists and creates the procedure.\n      \n      \n        Treat duplicate deployments as errors returns an error if the procedure already exists. If other versions of the procedure do not already exist, the procedure is created.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nNote: Not all options mentioned above are displayed due to screen size limit.\n\nIf you’re new to SQL and want more information about embedding SQL in host languages, there’s a lot of information about this topic in the Db2 for z/OS documentation.\n\nRoutine options\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Enable debugging option to specify whether this procedure is available to be debugged.\n  \n  \n    Use the WLM environment option to specify which Workload Manager environment will be used to debug the procedure. If you enable debugging but leave this field empty, the default WLM environment will used.\n  \n  \n    Use the ASU time limit option to set the ASUTIME, which is the number of CPU seconds permitted for each SQL statement. The default value of 0 means NO LIMIT and is not recommended.\n  \n  \n    Use the Additional routine options field to specify any additional options that you want to include. Separate each option with a semicolon. For example:\n  \n\n\n   QUALIFIER ADMF002; ISOLATION LEVEL RS\n\n\nExternal options\n\n\n\n\n  \n    The Build utility field identifies the Db2 SQL procedure processor, SYSPROC.DSNTPSMP, which is used to create an external SQL stored procedure.\n  \n  \n    Use the Precompile options option to specify options for precompiling the C language program that Db2 generates for the external SQL procedure. Do not specify the HOST option. For a list of these options see SQL processing options.\n  \n  \n    Use the Compile options option to specify options for compiling the C language program that Db2 generates for the external SQL procedure.\n  \n  \n    Use the Prelink options option to specify options for prelinking the C language program that Db2 generates for the external SQL procedure.\n  \n  \n    Use the Link options option to specify options for linking the C language program that Db2 generates for the external SQL procedure.\n  \n  \n    Use the Bind options option to specify options for binding the external SQL procedure package. Do not specify the MEMBER or LIBRARY option for the Db2 BIND PACKAGE command. For a list of these options, see BIND and REBIND options.\n  \n\n\nClick Deploy to finish the configuration and begin the deployment process for the procedure.\n\nRunning a stored procedure\n\nYou can run a stored procedure by using any of the following methods:\n\n\n  From within the catalog navigation view by clicking Run from the overflow menu\n  From within a .spsql file by clicking Run stored procedure from the context menu or the Run stored procedure icon\n  From the SQL editor either by clicking Run All or highlighting part of the file and clicking Run Selected SQL\n\n\nIf your stored procedure contains input variables, you’ll be prompted to specify values for them before the stored procedure executes, as shown in the following figure.

For example:\n  \n\n\n    \"ADMF002\",\"ADMF003\",\"ADMF004\"\n\n\nAbout commit and rollback options: The commit and rollback options behave a little differently with stored procedures. First, by default, all stored procedures run with COMMIT ON RETURN NO. You can change this behavior by including the COMMIT ON RETURN YES clause in your stored procedure DDL. If you need more control over the SQL statements in a stored procedure at the unit of work level, see COMMIT and ROLLBACK statements in a stored procedure.\n\nSecond, Db2 Developer Extension runs only the first stored procedure in a file and ignores any other SQL statements that you might have selected to run. If you select Commit on completion or Rollback changes on completion, processing will end after the first stored procedure is processed, even if you intended to run additional SQL statements in that same file. See Committing and rolling back changes for more information."

Db2 Developer Extension uses the number sign character (#) as the default terminator character, but you can use any terminator character you want by setting an SQL routine option.\n\nNote: Currently, Db2 Developer Extension deployment option supports only one UDF per .udfsql file. When UDF options are specified, only the first UDF in the file will be executed; additional UDFs and SQL statements will be ignored.\n\nWe’ll use the following SQL user-defined function throughout this article to demonstrate how to deploy a UDF. This UDF takes in a string as input and returns the text in reverse order. You can paste it into a file so that you try things out for yourself.\n\nREVERSE.udfsql\n\nCREATE FUNCTION ADMF001.REVERSE(INSTR VARCHAR(4000))\n    RETURNS VARCHAR(4000)\n    VERSION V1\n    DETERMINISTIC NO EXTERNAL ACTION CONTAINS SQL\n    BEGIN\n    DECLARE REVSTR, RESTSTR VARCHAR(4000) DEFAULT '';\n    DECLARE LEN INT;\n    IF INSTR IS NULL THEN\n    RETURN NULL;\n    END IF;\n    SET (RESTSTR, LEN) = (INSTR, LENGTH(INSTR));\n    WHILE LEN &gt; 0 DO\n    SET (REVSTR, RESTSTR, LEN) \n        = (SUBSTR(RESTSTR, 1, 1) CONCAT REVSTR, \n        SUBSTR(RESTSTR, 2, LEN - 1),\n        LEN - 1);\n    END WHILE;\n    RETURN REVSTR;\nEND\n\n\nHere’s how that same SQL user-defined function looks in Db2 Developer Extension:\n\n\n\nThe file extension of .udfsql identifies it as an SQL user-defined function. When you open a .udfsql file in Db2 Developer Extension, you get some additional actions in the toolbar in the upper right corner of the view:\n\n\n\nFrom left to right, these actions are Deploy, Debug, and Run. We’ll cover deploying and running in the following sections.\n\nDeploying a user-defined function\n\nYou can deploy a user-defined function by using any of the following methods:\n\n\n  From within the .udfsql file by clicking Deploy user-defined function from the context menu or the Deployment icon\n  From within the catalog navigation view by clicking Deploy from the overflow menu\n\n\nThe Deployment view is where you can set and customize deployment options and save the options for the .udfsql file. These options are used only during deployment and do not impact the DDL source code.\n\nThe Deployment view consists of two sections: Deployment options and Routine options.\n\nDeployment options\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Database connection option to select a connection from the list of defined connections. See Creating a database connection for more information.\n  \n  \n    Use the Target schema option for unqualified UDFs. This field is enabled only for unqualified UDFs. If the UDF is qualified (like the one in our example CREATE FUNCTION statement, which is qualified to ADMF001), the field is disabled. If you leave this field empty, the JDBC property currentSchema will be used. If currentSchema is not set, the JDBC connection username will be used.\n  \n  \n    Use the Build owner option to specify the owner of the UDF. If this field is left empty, the JDBC property currentSQLID will be used. If currentSQLID is not set, the JDBC connection username will be used.\n  \n  \n    Use the Default path option for resolving an unqualified data type, function, or procedure referenced by the UDF that’s being deployed. You can specify multiple schemas, each one separated by a comma. For example:\n  \n\n\n    \"ADMF002\",\"ADMF003\",\"ADMF004\"\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Duplicate handling option to specify the behavior of the deployment if the UDF already exists:\n\n    \n      \n        Alter duplicates modifies the CREATE FUNCTION DDL to ALTER FUNCTION if the UDF already exists. Optionally, you can choose not to activate the UDF upon deployment; otherwise, it’s activated by default. If VERSION is not specified in the DDL, the Alter duplicates option is not displayed.\n      \n      \n        Drop duplicates calls DROP FUNCTION before running the CREATE FUNCTION if the UDF already exists, creates the UDF, and activates it upon deployment. By default, Db2 activates the first version of a UDF.\n      \n      \n        Treat duplicate deployments as errors returns an error if the UDF already exists.\n      \n    \n  \n\n\nRoutine options\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Use the Enable debugging option to specify whether this UDF is available to be debugged.\n  \n  \n    Use the WLM environment option to specify which Workload Manager environment will be used to debug the UDF. If you enable debugging but leave this field empty, the default WLM environment will used.\n  \n  \n    Use the ASU time limit option to set the ASUTIME, which is the number of CPU seconds permitted for each SQL statement. The default value of 0 means NO LIMIT and is not recommended.\n  \n  \n    Use the Additional routine options field to specify any additional options that you want to include. Separate each option with a semicolon. For example:\n  \n\n\n   QUALIFIER ADMF002; ISOLATION LEVEL RS\n\n\nNote: The Routine options tab is only available for compiled SQL scalar functions.\n\nClick Deploy to finish the configuration and begin the deployment process for the UDF.\n\nAfter your SQL user-defined function is executed, the following output is displayed in the Status tab.\n\n\n\nThe Status tab contains overall execution status. If an error occurred, the status will contain SQL code, SQL state, and Message text.\n\nRunning a user-defined function\n\nYou can run a UDF by using any of the following methods:\n\n\n  From within the catalog navigation view by clicking Run from the overflow menu\n  From within the .udfsql file by clicking Run User-Defined Function from the context menu or the Run User-Defined Function icon\n  From within the SQL editor either by clicking Run All or by highlighting part of the file and clicking Run Selected SQL\n\n\nIf your UDF contains input variables, you’ll be prompted to specify values for them before the UDF executes, as shown in the following figure. Note that built-in data types for each input variable are detected automatically and are set to the correct data type.\n\n\n\nAfter your UDF runs, the following output is displayed in these tabs:\n\n\n  The Status tab contains the overall execution status. If an error occurred, the status will contain SQL code, SQL state, and Message text.\n\n\n\n\n\n  The Results tab contains the output from running the UDF.\n\n\n\n\nEach time you run a UDF, the QUERY HISTORY view is updated with a record of that activity."

By default, the Select column field is populated with Name and the Select operator field is populated with Contains.\n\nIn the following example, we enter DD in the Value field for the Name column (note that the filter feature is case-sensitive). Then we click the Add filter icon to display a new set of input fields, and we select Encoding scheme of EBCDIC. When we click Apply, only the databases that contain the characters DD and that have an encoding scheme of EBCDIC are displayed.\n\nWe click the Filter by fields icon again to specify an additional criteria: buffer pools that start with BP0.\n\n\n\nWhen all of these criteria are applied, we’re presented with only those databases that:\n\n\n  Contain the characters DD\n  Have an encoding scheme equal to EBCDIC\n  Have a buffer pool that starts with BP0\n\n\nThe operators and values vary depending on the characteristics of each column.\n\nTo remove a filter, click the Remove filter icon on the right side of the Filter settings dialog, and to remove all filters click Clear all.\n\nNote that certain types of catalog object tables contain columns that can have blank values. These include:\n\n\n  DATABASE - Storage group, Buffer pool\n  PACKAGE - Version\n  PLAN - Group member\n  STORED PROCEDURE - Version\n  TRIGGER - Version\n  UDF - Language, Version\n\n\nWhen you specify a blank value for one of these columns in conjunction with the EqualTo (=) or NotEqualTo (&lt;&gt;) operator, you can still apply the filter criteria. For example, specifying the Storage group column for a database object, and selecting the Equal to operator but leaving the Value field blank is a valid filter set of criteria."

This string can cause Visual Studio Code, and subsequently the formatter, to interpret every character that follows as part of the string until another `'` is matched.\n\nTo escape the `\\` from `'\\'`, use `\\\\`, which results in `'\\\\'`."

						"content": "Getting started\n\nDb2 for z/OS Developer Extension provides a number of features that make it easy for you to write well-formed SQL, including:\n\n\n  Code snippets\n  Syntax highlighting\n  Code completion\n  Signature help\n\n\nIt also also provides built-in capability for connecting to Db2 for z/OS databases and running your SQL. This article provides an introduction to using these basic features.\n\nFor a quick overview of the Db2 Developer Extension interface, see Getting started with Db2 for z/OS Developer Extension and VS Code.\n\nImportant: Before you start to work with Db2 Developer Extension, make sure that your system meets all of the prerequisites and that you have configured Java, that you have set the JDBC license files and JDBC driver files, and that you have specified the required port numbers.\n\nCreating a simple SQL statement\n\n\n  \n    Open the Db2 Developer Extension view in Visual Studio Code either by clicking View &gt; Extensions and selecting it from the list of extensions or by clicking the following icon in the Activity Bar: \n  \n  \n    Now, create a new file by clicking File &gt; New File. Save your file as anyname.sql. The .sql suffix identifies the file to Db2 Developer Extension as an SQL file, so as soon as you save it you can start using Db2 Developer Extension’s editing features.\n\n    Note: Although our examples use a .sql file, you can embed SQL in any type of file and run that SQL directly from Db2 Developer Extension. See Running SQL from different types of files for more information.\n  \n  \n    Type the first letters of the SELECT statement. You’ll only need to type a few letters before SELECT statement shows up in the list of available SQL elements.\n\n    \n  \n  \n    Click SELECT statement to insert a code snippet that provides the basic structure of this statement, including required and commonly used parameters.\n\n    \n\n    Notice a few things about the code that was added:\n\n    \n      \n        The snippet contains just the basic parameters. Many SQL statements have a ton of parameters, too many for even the most experienced developer to remember, so a link to the complete syntax is provided at the top of the snippet.\n      \n      \n        The syntax elements are color coded based on element type. For example, keywords are one color and variables are a different color. Syntax highlighting makes it easier to parse your code and to pick out the elements that you’re looking for. Also, if you prefer to use a different color scheme, you can customize the highlighting theme to suit your preferences.\n      \n      \n        Hover over one of the elements that’s underlined with a squiggly line, such as search-condition,  and notice that a message is displayed that indicates a syntax error. Whenever possible, these messages include potential fixes for the syntax error. To display all of the syntax errors in a file, you can click View problems in one of these pop-up messages or you can open the PROBLEMS by clicking View &gt; Problems.\n      \n    \n  \n  \n    Let’s get back to that SELECT statement. Highlight column-name after the SELECT keyword, type LOC and press Ctrl + Space. The LOCATE_IN_STRING clause shows up in a list of available syntax elements. Select it to insert it, then type an open parenthesis to display a description of the LOCATE_IN_STRING syntax and a link to detailed reference information about it.\n\n    \n  \n\n\nThese features are useful when you know which syntax element you want to insert, but maybe you don’t know the precise syntax that you need to enter. They also save you time and reduce the chance that you enter something incorrectly."

Db2 Developer Extension makes it easy to explore the Db2 catalog through its catalog navigation support.\n\nEnabling catalog navigation\n\nUsing the catalog navigation feature requires read access to several Db2 system catalog tables. If you’re already working with another tool that provides you with access to the Db2 catalog, it’s likely that these privileges have already been granted. If not, the following statements can be used to grant these privileges:\n\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSCHECKDEP TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSCOLUMNS TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSCONTROLS TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSDATABASE TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSDATATYPES TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSDEPENDENCIES TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSFOREIGNKEYS TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSINDEXES TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSJAROBJECTS TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSKEYCOLUSE TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSKEYS TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSPACKAGE TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSPACKDEP TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSPACKLIST TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSPACKSTMT TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSPARMS TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSPLAN TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSROUTINES TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSSEQUENCES TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSSEQUENCESDEP TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSSTOGROUP TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSTABCONST TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSTABLEPART TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSTABLES TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSTABLESPACE TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSTRIGGERS TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSVARIABLES TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSVIEWDEP TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSVIEWS TO {user ID};\nGRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.SYSVOLUMES TO {user ID};\n\n\nwhere {user ID} is the authorization ID or role that you want to grant read access to.\n\nViewing REST services\n\nViewing REST services requires some additional configuration.\n\n\n  Ensure that REST services are enabled on Db2 for z/OS. See Enabling Db2 REST services for instructions.\n  Use either of the following methods to authorize access to REST services:\n    \n      Submit the GRANT SELECT ON SYSIBM.DSNSERVICE TO {user ID}; statement.\n      Complete the instructions in Authorization of REST service users.\n    \n  \n\n\nExploring Db2 objects\n\nAfter catalog navigation has been enabled by granting read access to Db2 system catalog tables, when you create a database connection, the following object types that are associated with that connection are listed under the connection name:\n\n  Databases\n  Global variables\n  Indexes\n  Packages\n  Plans\n  REST services\n  Schemas\n  Sequences (including sequence aliases)\n  Storage groups\n  Stored procedures\n  Tables (including table aliases)\n  Table spaces\n  Triggers\n  User-defined functions\n  User-defined types\n  Views (including view aliases)\n  XML schemas\n\n\nYou can expand an object to see detailed information about that object (columns, constraints, indexes, and so on).\n\nWhen browsing a list of objects, you can use the the toolbar to change the rows returned and get numerical information about the objects.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    Click the search icon () to search within the displayed rows.\n  \n  \n    Click the filter icon () to filter the rows by one or more criteria. Specify a valid pattern expression based on the LIKE predicate, and use the exact case (the filter feature is case-sensitive). For more information, see Filtering by multiple columns.\n  \n  \n    For object types that allow implicitly created objects, click the view icon () to view or hide these objects.\n  \n  \n    Display n rows shows the number of rows fetched.\n  \n  \n    Click Max rows: n to change the maximum number of rows that can be fetched.\n  \n  \n    Click Total rows: n to get the total number of objects for the object type in the Db2 catalog.\n  \n\n\nFor an individual storage group, database, and schema, you can view objects within the object in the Objects tab.\n\n\n\nFor an individual table, you can view a table’s columns, contraints, indexes, and data.\n\n\n\nCatalog object reference\n\nThe following list shows which characteristics are provided for each object type:\n\n\n  Databases\n    \n      Properties\n      Objects\n    \n  \n  Global variables\n    \n      Properties\n      References\n    \n  \n  Indexes\n    \n      Properties\n      Columns\n    \n  \n  Packages\n    \n      Properties\n      Statements\n      Dependencies\n    \n  \n  Plans\n    \n      Properties\n      Packages\n    \n  \n  REST services\n    \n      Properties\n      Request body\n      Response body\n    \n  \n  Schemas\n    \n      Properties\n      Objects\n    \n  \n  Sequences\n    \n      Properties\n      References\n    \n  \n  Storage groups\n    \n      Properties\n      Objects\n    \n  \n  Stored procedures\n    \n      Properties (differs depending on the type of procedure)\n      Options (differs depending on the type of procedure)\n      Parameters\n      Packages\n      DDL (output is limited to 7,500 characters)\n      JAR dependencies (applies only to external Java stored procedures)\n      Source (applies only to external Java stored procedures)\n    \n  \n  Tables\n    \n      Properties\n      Columns\n      Constraints\n      Indexes\n      Data\n    \n  \n  Table spaces\n    \n      Properties\n      Partitions\n      Tables\n    \n  \n  Triggers\n    \n      Properties (differs depending on the type of trigger)\n      DDL\n    \n  \n  User-defined functions\n    \n      Properties (differs depending on the type of user-defined function)\n      Options (differs depending on the type of user-defined function)\n      Parameters\n      Packages\n      DDL\n    \n  \n  User-defined types\n    \n      Properties (differs depending on the type of user-defined type)\n      References\n    \n  \n  Views\n    \n      Properties\n      Columns\n      Data\n      Dependencies\n      DDL\n    \n  \n  XML schemas\n    \n      Data"

						"content": "Running SQL from different types of files\n\nA unique and extremely useful feature of Db2 Developer Extension is the ability to run your SQL code directly from any type of file without modifying it to accommodate the syntax rules of the language that you’re writing in. Whether you’re writing in a traditional mainframe language such as COBOL, PL/I, JCL or C or in a modern language such as Python, Node.js, or Rust, or even playing around by using a text file, you can embed your SQL in the file, select it, run it, and view the results.\n\nThis feature is useful for validating your SQL code from directly within the host language file, without the overhead of copying and pasting it into a .sql or, for stored procedures, into a .spsql file first.\n\nUsing this feature is pretty straightforward. The only prerequisite is that you have a database connection.  You can associate a specific connection to the file that you want to run your SQL from, but if you don’t, Db2 Developer Extension will try to establish a connection for you.\n\n\n  Open a file and add a SQL statement.\n  \n    As an optional step, you can specify JDBC runtime options by right-clicking anywhere in the editor and selecting Run SQL Options from the context menu.\n\n    For example, you can specify commit and rollback settings, and you can set the CURRENT SCHEMA and CURRENT PATH special registers. For information about the commit and rollback options, see Committing and rolling back changes.\n  \n  Highlight the statement, right-click it, and select Run Selected SQL from the context menu.\n\n\nThat’s it. Results are displayed in the SQL Results page that opens when the statement completes and stored in the Query History view.\n\n\n\nOne other thing: if you’re coding in a .sql file, you can use Run Selected SQL to run just the specific statements that you’re working on, or you can run the entire file by selecting Run All.\n\nIf you’re new to SQL and want more information about embedding SQL in host languages, there’s a lot of information about this topic in the Db2 for z/OS documentation.\n\nExamples\n\nThe following examples show this feature in action with several different programming languages.\n\nC example\n\n\n\nCOBOL example\n\n\n\nJava example\n\n\n\nJCL example\n\n\n\nNode.js example\n\n\n\nPython example"

Additional information about optional configuration settings and features are described in [Advanced options for setting up an SQL tuning environment]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/tuning-sql-queries/advanced-tuning-environment-options.html).\n\n**Important:** The SQL tuning features of Db2 Developer Extension require additional software. See [Software requirements for using the SQL tuning features]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/tuning-sql-queries/sql-tuning-requirements.html) for details. Make sure that one of the SQL tuning options is installed on your system before you start to set up your SQL tuning environment.\n\n## Adding an SQL Tuning Services server\nThe first step in setting up an SQL tuning environment is adding an SQL Tuning Services server.\n\n1. In the **SQL TUNING SERVICES SERVERS** view, click the plus sign (**+**) to open the **Add SQL Tuning Services Server** dialog.\n\n2.

Make sure that one of the SQL tuning options is installed on your system before you start to set up your SQL tuning environment.\n\n## Adding an SQL Tuning Services server\n\nThe first step in setting up an SQL tuning environment is adding an SQL Tuning Services server.\n\n1.

Your options for using or not using a tuning profile are dependent on the security mechanism that you use in your environment. \n\n- If you are using security mechanism 18 (SSL) to tune SQL, you must create and use tuning profiles to tune SQL. See [Creating a tuning profile]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/tuning-sql-queries/setting-up-a-tuning-environment.html#creating-a-tuning-profile) for instructions.\n\n- Security mechanisms 7 and 9 do not support the use of tuning profiles. If you are using one of these security mechanisms to tune SQL, see [Tuning without a tuning profile]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/tuning-sql-queries/setting-up-a-tuning-environment.html#tuning-without-a-tuning-profile) for more information.\n\n- Security mechanism 3 supports both methods for tuning SQL.\n\n## Creating a tuning profile\n\nTuning profiles enable a SQL Tuning Services server to access the Db2 for z/OS database that contains the SQL that you want to tune. A tuning profile includes a valid Db2 for z/OS user ID and password, security information, and location information for the target database (host, location, and so on).\n\n**Note:** The use of tuning profiles is optional in certain situations. See [Tuning without a tuning profile]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/tuning-sql-queries/setting-up-a-tuning-environment.html#tuning-without-a-tuning-profile) for details. However, if you are using security mechanism 18, you must use a tuning profile.\n\nThe benefit of using tuning profiles is that they can be reused and shared. For example, a database administrator can create a single tuning profile with specific credentials and make it available to multiple Db2 Developer Extension users. However, if you specify a Db2 for z/OS password when you create a tuning profile, this password must be updated whenever the password is updated in RACF. To avoid this additional overhead, you can use multi-factor authentication instead of a password when you create a tuning profile.\n\nTo create a tuning profile:\n\n1. From the **SQL TUNING SERVICES SERVERS** view, right-click an SQL Tuning Services server and click **Show Tuning Connection Profiles**. The **Tuning Connection Profiles** window opens for the server you selected.\n\n2. Click the blue plus sign on the right side of the dialog. The **Create a tuning profile** window opens.\n\n3. Select a Db2 connection to associate with the tuning connection profile and assign a name. Optionally, you can specify additional properties such as the type of security mechanism to use and SSL properties.\n\n4. Leave the **Associate this tuning connection profile to the selected Db2 connection** check box selected.  \n\n   **Important:** Clear this checkbox only if you don't intend to use this profile to start tuning your SQL right away. If you clear this checkbox now, you'll need to associate this profile to a Db2 connection before you can use it to tune your SQL.\n\n5. Click **Create profile**. A list of existing profiles is displayed, including the profile you just created. Keep this window open. You'll need it for the next task.\n\n    ![Creating a tuning connection profile]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tuning-create-profile.gif)\n\n    Optionally, you can specify JDBC properties when creating a tuning profile. Db2 Developer Extension supports the following JDBC properties:\n\n   - `currentPackagePath`\n   - `encryptionAlgorithm`\n   - `securityMechanism`\n   - `sslCertLocation`\n   - `sslConnection`\n   - `sslKeyStoreLocation`\n   - `sslKeyStorePassword`\n   - `sslTrustStoreLocation`\n   - `sslTrustStorePassword`\n   - `sslTrustStoreType`\n\n    ![Tuning profile optional properties]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tuning-with-profile-options.png)\n\n    When you select the `currentPackagePath` property to use a package in a collection ID that you specify, you can specify more than one collection ID. If a package is not found in the first collection ID that you specified, the next collection ID in the list is checked.\n\n    **Note**: After you set a collection ID or multiple collection IDs for the `currentPackagePath` property, you can reset the collection IDs by removing the `currentPackagePath` property from your tuning profile, saving the change, and then adding the `currentPackagePath` property back to your tuning profile. This process will automatically reset the `currentPackagePath` property with the value `NULLID, IBMTMS`. You can also reset the `currentPackagePath` property by deleting the existing tuning profile and creating a new profile to set a new value for the `currentPackagePath` property.\n\nNow that you've created a tuning profile, you must associate it with a Db2 database connection.\n\n1. Either create a new Db2 connection or edit an existing Db2 connection.\n\n2. Go to the **Tuning** tab and select a **Tuning Services server**.\n\n3. Turn the **Enable tuning profile** toggle on and select your tuning profile from the dropdown list.\n\n    ![Enable tuning profile toggle off]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tuning-profiles-toggle-off.png)\n\n    ![Enable tuning profile toggle on]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tuning-profiles-toggle-on.png)\n\n    **Note**: When the **Enable tuning profile** toggle is on, you can click **Create profile** to create additional tuning profiles.\n\n4. Click **Finish** to save the Db2 connection.\n\n## Tuning without a tuning profile\n\nThe use of tuning profiles is optional if you are using Db2 Developer Extension 2.1.6 and SQL Tuning Services APAR PH60806 has been applied. If you decide to not use a tuning profile, the authentication information in the database connection is used instead. Tuning without a profile supports security mechanism 3 and is required for security mechanism 7 and 9.\n\nIf you are tuning SQL without a tuning profile and you are using MFA, you will be prompted to enter an MFA token twice: when you first connect to Db2 and again when you initiate the tuning action. The tokens must be unique. Use the IBM Verify app to generate these MFA tokens.\n\n**Note:** Tuning without a profile enables you to select and run multiple tuning actions simultaneously. When you do so, the results for each of the tuning actions that you run will share the same Job ID.\n\n\n\nWhen you are tuning without a profile, you can specify JDBC properties. In most cases, specifying JDBC properties is optional; however, if you are using SSL to connect to Db2 and you are using a secure port _without_ a public CA, you can specify the following SSL-related properties: \n\n- `sslTrustStoreLocation`\n- `sslTrustStorePassword`\n- `sslTrustStoreType`\n- `sslKeyStoreLocation`\n- `sslKeyStorePassword`\n\nIf you are not using SSL or you are using SSL with a public CA, you do not need to specify these properties.\n\n**Usage notes:**\n- When the `sslConnection` property is set to `true`, if you specify these properties in the **Optional** tab, the property names will be automatically specified in the **Tuning** tab but no values will be assigned.\n- You can manually specify unique values for these properties in the **Tuning** tab; however, if you don't specify unique values in the **Tuning** tab, the values in the **Optional** tab are used for tuning actions.\n- Any values specified in the **Tuning** tab take precedence over values specified in the **Optional** tab.\n- If you delete a property from the **Tuning** tab, but the property still exists in the **Optional** tab, the property name will automatically be specified in the **Tuning** tab.\n- You can add these properties directly in the **Tuning** tab without specifying them in the **Optional** tab. \n\nIn addition to the SSL-related properties, you can use the `currentPackagePath` property, which enables you to use a package in a collection ID that you specify. You can specify more than one collection ID for the `currentPackagePath` property. If a package is not found in the first collection ID that you specified, the next collection ID in the list is checked.\n\nWhen the `currentPackagePath` property is specified in the **Optional** tab, both the property name and the specified value are automatically populated in the **Tuning** tab.\n\n![Tuning without a profile optional properties]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tuning-without-profile-options.png)\n\n## Creating EXPLAIN tables\n\nDb2 uses [EXPLAIN tables](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-for-zos/13?topic=tables-explain) to store information about SQL statements, access paths, and other elements that can affect SQL performance. The tuning connection profile needs its own set of EXPLAIN tables.\n\n1. Click three vertical dots at the end of the tuning connection profile you just created, and select **Create EXPLAIN tables**. The **Create EXPLAIN tables** window opens.\n\n2. Although all of the fields are optional, you'll typically want to provide at least a schema name and SQL ID.\n\n3. Click **Create**. A status message indicates that the EXPLAIN tables are being created.\n\n    ![Creating EXPLAIN tables]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tuning-create-explain-tables.png)\n\nYou can also standardize and drop EXPLAIN tables by clicking the three vertical dots."

The data_server_type field is required` when you attempt to create or edit a tuning profile, it's likely that the most current APAR has not been applied. See the SQL Tuning Services section in [Prerequisites for installing Db2 Developer Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ibm.db2forzosdeveloperextension#prerequisites-for-installing-db2-developer-extension) for the current APAR number. Apply this APAR and try to create or edit the tuning profile again.\n\n## Problems with selecting a tuning profile\n\n- If you click **Select a tuning profile** after attempting to run a tuning action when no tuning profile is associated with your database connection, the **Edit connection** page is displayed, but the list of tuning profilesis empty. Click the **Tuning** tab to populate the list of tuning profiles.\n\n  ![Tuning tab]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/troubleshooting-tuning-tab.png)\n\n- A similar situation occurs when you create a new profile by clicking **Create profile** on the **Edit connection** page. After you save your changes, the **Create a tuning connection profile** page closes but your profile is not included in the list of tuning profiles. As with the previous situation, click the **Tuning** tab to display your new tuning profile.\n\n## Problems with opening subsequent Tuning Summary pages\n\nIf you display summary results from the TUNING HISTORY, and the first set of results that you select were generated without using a tuning profile, when you select additional summary results, the results will be added to the current view. To prevent this unexpected behavior, close the opened tuning summary result view first before opening other summary results."

To correct this situation, you must take one of the following actions:\n\n- **Upgrade TLS on z/OS**\n\n  Contact your security administrator who is responsible for administering SSL connectivity and ask them to upgrade the TLS version on the z/OS system to 1.2 or 1.3. If this isn't feasible, reconfigure your client to accept TLS 1.0 or 1.1 connections as described below.\n\n- **Reconfigure your workstation to accept TLS 1.0 or 1.1 connections**\n\n  If the TLS version on z/OS can't be upgraded, you'll need to enable Java on your workstation to accept TLS 1.0 or 1.1 connections.\n\n  **Important:** The following process will affect all applications that use the version of Java that you are modifying. Consider this impact before you complete these steps.\n\n  1. Edit the `java.security` JDK file on your workstation. The location of this file depends on the version of Java that you're using.\n     - If you're using Java 8, it's located at `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security`\n     - If you're using Java 11 or later, it's located at `$JAVA_HOME/conf/security/java.security`\n  2. Locate the `jdk.tls.disabledAlgorithms` property within the `java.security` file and delete the `TLSv1` and `TLSv1.1` entries.\n  3. Save and close the file."

For example, currently only the use of containers and ssh have been tested and validated. You might be able to set up a remote Db2 Developer Extension in other environments by using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) or GitHub Codespaces, but these environments have not yet been tested.\n\n- Remote development using Db2 Developer Extension requires the [prerequisites](https://github.com/IBM/db2forzosdeveloperextension-about#prerequisites-for-installing-db2-developer-extension) for Db2 Developer Extension to be installed on the remote development environment rather than on the local environment (except libsecret if you are running Db2 Developer Extension on Linux).\n\n- To debug a stored procedure in a remote development environment that uses containers, you must complete the following additional configuration steps to establish communication between the Db2 subsystem that you're connected to and the Db2 debugger session manager:\n  1. Edit the `devcontainer.json` file and add the following arguments:\n     ```\n     \"runArgs\": [\n         \"--net=host\",\n         \"--add-host=docker:\",\n         \"--hostname=docker\"\n     ]\n     ```     \n     where:\n    - `--net=host` allows processes that run inside the container to share the host's network namespace.\n    - `--add-host=docker:` adds a hostname mapping to the IP address inside the container.\n    - `--hostname=docker` indicates to the container what the hostname is.\n  \n  2. Start the remote container session, then open your Visual Studio Code settings and change the **Remote local port host** setting to **allInterfaces**:\n\n     ![Remote local port host setting]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/tips-tricks-remote-development-settings-for-debugger.png)"

When you create a stored procedure that includes DBCLOB parameters, you need to specify `PARAMETER CCSID UNICODE`, and if the stored procedure includes DBCLOBs in the body, you need to specify `APPLICATION ENCODING SCHEMA UNICODE`.\n\n```\nCREATE PROCEDURE ADMF001.TEST_DBCLOB (\n  IN VAR1 DBCLOB,\n  INOUT VAR2 DBCLOB,\n  OUT VAR3 DBCLOB\n  )\n  APPLICATION ENCODING SCHEME UNICODE\n  PARAMETER CCSID UNICODE\n  VERSION V1\n  ISOLATION LEVEL CS\n  LANGUAGE SQL\n  BEGIN\n    SET VAR2 = '你好';\n    SET VAR3 = VAR1;\n  END\n```\n\nSetting this input returns the following output:\n\n```\nVAR1  IN: HELLOWORLD\nVAR2 OUT: 你好\nVAR3 OUT: HELLOWORLD\n```"

						"content": "# {{ page.title }}\n\nDb2 Developer Extension integrates with IBM Db2 CI/CD Expert for z/OS to enable you to make changes to existing DDL, validate those changes by using the existing site rules, and run a change impact report to analyze and verify the changes before submitting a pull request from your UMS environment.\n\n## Before you begin\n\nYou must have a valid connection to an existing Db2 CI/CD Expert for z/OS server.\n\n## Associating an application and making changes to DDL\n\nTo make changes to an existing DDL file, associate the DDL file with an application in a Db2 CI/CD Expert server:\n\n1. Select a **.ddl** file.\n\n2.  In the VS Code **Status Bar**, click **No Db2 CI/CD Expert server**.\n\n    ![VS code status bar indicating no server connection]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/cicde-no-server-connection.png)\n\n3. Select the server that contains the application that needs to be associated with the DDL file.\n\n    Application discovery starts. If the DDL file is found in any of the applications in the server, the DDL file is associated with that server and the **No Db2 CI/CD Expert server** indicator updates to **ServerName > Application > ApplicationName**.\n\n    ![VS code status bar indicating server connection with application]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/cicde-with-server-connection.png)\n\n4. Edit the DDL file with any changes that you need to make for the application.\n\n5. Save your changes.\n\nIf any site rule violations are reported when you save your changes, you should fix them before continuing. However, if these site rule violations occurred while you were editing the DDL they can be ignored. For more information, see [Managing site rules](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/dcefz/1.1.0?topic=features-managing-site-rules).\n\n## Running a change impact report\n\nAfter you've made changes to the DDL file, you can run an impact report to see how the changes will affect the objects that the application depends on.\n\nTo run a change impact report, select the **.ddl** file that you modified, then right-click and select **Run CI/CD Expert Impact Report** or click the **CI/CD Expert Impact Report** icon.\n\n   ![Impact report icon]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/impact-report-icon.png)\n\nThis action submits a job to the Db2 CI/CD Expert server with the modified DDL and the associated application ID. Note that it can take a while for the job to run. By default, Db2 Developer Extension will attempt to fetch the impact report every 2 seconds for a maximum of 100 attempts. To change these default settings:\n\n1. Click the **Manage** icon at the lower left corner of the VS Code window.\n\n2. Click **Settings** > **Extensions** > **IBM Db2 for z/OS Developer Extension**, and locate the **Fetch Interval** and **Max Number of Fetch Attempts** fields:\n\n\n  ![Fetch configuration settings]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/fetch-config-settings.png)\n\n  - Use the **Fetch Interval** option to specify a number in seconds to indicate how often a call is sent to the Db2 CI/CD Expert server to fetch the impact report until the job is complete. Depending on the size of your application you can increase the number to your preferred value. Increasing the interval between fetch attempts is helpful for larger applications where you might not want to make fetch requests as often.\n\n  - Use the **Max Number of Fetch Attempts** option to specify a number to indicate the maximum number of attempts to fetch the impact report. When the maximum number of attempts is reached, no more attempts will be made to fetch the impact report.\n\n\nAfter the job is completed, the **Changes impact report** view is displayed. The changes made to the DDL are displayed in these tabs:\n\n   - The **Critical changes** tab shows changes that altered the existing structure of an object in the application such as dropping and re-creating an existing table.\n\n   - The **All changes** tab shows all of the changes made to any of the objects in the DDL.\n\n   - The **Full report** tab shows all of the objects in the DDL including objects with critical changes, non-critical changes, and objects with no changes.\n\n   ![Changes impact report view]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/changes-impact-report.png)\n\nAfter you've finished making changes to the DDL and verified the changes in the impact report, you can submit a pull request from UMS."

						"content": "# {{ page.title }}\n\nAs an alternative to the standard SQL editor interface, Db2 Developer Extension supports the use of a notebook style SQL editor, which provides more flexibility than the standard SQL editor.\n\nFor example, with a notebook editor you can:\n\n- Create, edit, and run multiple SQL statements either one at a time or collectively from a single window.\n- View the results of running multiple SQL statements within a single window.\n- Easily insert markdown comments into  your code for easier readability.  \n\nTo use the notebook editor:\n\n1. Create a new file that has an extension of **.isql**. The notebook editor is invoked automatically for **.isql** files.\n\n2. Click **+ Code** to open a new cell, and type a SQL statement into that cell, for example:\n\n   ```\n   SELECT * FROM SYSIBM.SYSTABLES;\n   ```\n   Notice that the statement is labeled as `Plain Text` in the lower right side of the cell. \n\n3. To get the editor to recognize your input as SQL, connect to Db2 either by clicking the connection mechanism in the bottom-left corner of the window or by clicking **Select Kernel** in the upper-right corner of the editor and selecting a connection. As soon as you connect to Db2, your statement is recognized as SQL and syntax highlighting is applied.\n\n4. Run your statement by clicking the **Run** button at the left side of the cell. The results are displayed directly below the cell.\n\n   ![Using the notebook editor]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/images/sql-notebook.gif)\n\n5. Now let's run another SQL statement. You have a couple of options:\n\n   - You can type the new SQL statement into the same cell as your first SQL statement and click **Run**.  This approach displays the results in the same cell; however, both statements are run; not just the new statement.\n   - You can type the new SQL statement into a new cell and work with it independently.\n\n6. Explore some of the other features of the notebook editor on your own:\n\n   - Create a new markdown cell instead of a code cell by clicking **+ Markdown**. Your text will be saved as markdown in the file.\n   - Rearrange the order of the cells by clicking and dragging them."

						"title": "Working with user-defined types",
						"categories": "",
						"url": " /docs/working-with-stored-procedures/working-with-user-defined-types.html",
						"content": "# {{ page.title }}\n\nYou can use Db2 Developer Extension to create [user-defined types](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-for-zos/13?topic=concepts-user-defined-types). This article describes how to create the two types of user-defined types: distinct types and array types.\n\n## Working with user-defined types: Distinct\n\nYou can create and use a custom data type that's called a [user-defined distinct type](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEPEK_13.0.0/sqlref/src/tpc/db2z_distincttypessql.html) in Db2 for z/OS. For example, let's say that you keep email documents that are sent to your company in a Db2 table. The Db2 data type of an email document is a CLOB, but you define it as a distinct type so that you can control the types of operations that are performed on the email data. The distinct type is defined like this:\n\n```\nCREATE DISTINCT TYPE E_MAIL AS CLOB(5M); \n```\n\nNow you can define and write a native stored procedure or user-defined function to search for and return the following information about an email document:\n\n- Subject\n- Sender\n- Date sent\n- Message content\n- Indicator of whether the document contains a user-specified string.\n\nThe following example shows how to create a user-defined distinct type for a currency (US_DOLLAR), how to include it in a stored procedure, and how to do some calculations.\n\nNote that the US_DOLLAR distinct type does not automatically inherit the functions and operators of its source type, DECIMAL. You can use **casting** functions to assign values other than host variables. Also, the DISTINCT keyword is optional.\n\n```\nCREATE DISTINCT TYPE US_DOLLAR AS DECIMAL(9,2);\nCREATE TYPE EURO AS DECIMAL(9,2);\n \nCREATE PROCEDURE ADMF001.SALESSUM (\n   IN DOLLAR_AMOUNT US_DOLLAR,\n   IN EURO_AMOUNT EURO,\n   OUT TOTAL_DOLLAR US_DOLLAR,\n   OUT TOTAL_EURO EURO\n  )\n  LANGUAGE SQL\n  VERSION V1\n  ISOLATION LEVEL CS \n  BEGIN\n    SET TOTAL_DOLLAR = DECIMAL(DOLLAR_AMOUNT)*200;\n    SET TOTAL_EURO = DECIMAL(EURO_AMOUNT)+300.07;\n  END\n```\n\nSetting this input returns the following output:\n\n```\nDOLLAR_AMOUNT  IN: 34.50\nEURO_AMOUNT    IN: 500\nTOTAL_DOLLAR  OUT: 6900.00\nTOTAL_DOLLAR  OUT: 30507.00\n```\n\n## Working with user-defined types: Arrays\n\nAn array value is a structure that contains an ordered collection of elements. Arrays make it easier to exchange long lists of values with the Db2 server. You can create a user-defined data type for an array in Db2 for z/OS.\n\nThe following example shows how to create an ordinary array user-defined type (PHONENUMBERS) that can contain a maximum of 50 elements. The elements are of the DECIMAL(10,0) data type. The array index starts with 1.\n\n```\nCREATE TYPE PHONENUMBERS AS DECIMAL(10,0) ARRAY[50];\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE ADMF001.TESTPROC(\n   IN PHONENUMBER PHONENUMBERS,\n   OUT outPHONENUMBER PHONENUMBERS\n  )\n  LANGUAGE SQL\n  VERSION V1\n  ISOLATION LEVEL CS\n  BEGIN\n    SET outPHONENUMBER[1]= PHONENUMBER[1];\n  END\n```\n\nSetting this input returns the following output:\n\n```\nPHONENUMBER      IN: [6262158888;4056789999]\noutPHONENUMBER  OUT: [6262158888]\n```\n\nThe following example shows how to create an ordinary arrays user-defined type for time and timestamp with time zone. The default TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE length is 6.\n\n```\nCREATE TYPE TIMEARRAY AS TIME ARRAY[];\nCREATE TYPE TIMESTAMPARRAY AS TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE ARRAY[];\n\nCREATE PROCEDURE ADMF001.TESTPROC (\n  IN inTIME TIMEARRAY,\n  IN inTIMESTAMPWITHZONE TIMESTAMPARRAY\n  OUT outTIME TIME\n  OUT outTIMESTAPWITHZONE TIMESTAMPARRAY\n    )\n  LANGUAGE SQL\n  VERSION V1\n  ISOLATION LEVEL CS\n  BEGIN\n    SET outTIME = INTIME[1];\n    SET outTIMESTAMPWITHZONE[1] = inTIMESTAMPWITHZONE[1];\n  END\n```\n\nSetting this input returns the following output:\n\n```\ninTIME               IN: [08:09:01;10:15:00;11:08:30]\ninTIMESTAMPWITHZONE  IN: [2020-10-15 15:01:01.111213141516+4:00]\noutTIME             OUT: 08:09:01\noutTIMESTAPWITHZONE OUT: [2020-10-15 15:01:01.111213]\n```"
