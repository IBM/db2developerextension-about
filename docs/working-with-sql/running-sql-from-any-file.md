IBM Db2 Developer Extension allows you to run SQL statements from any file in Visual Studio Code. You can run SQL statements from any file type, not just `.sql` files. This feature allows you to integrate Db2 workflows seamlessly into your existing code files, notebooks, or documentation.

### Procedure

To run SQL statements from any file:

1. Open any file in Visual Studio Code (for example, `.sql`, `.txt`, `.md`, or even code files like `.js`, `.py`).

3. Select the SQL statement that you want to run.

4. Right-click the selected SQL statement and choose **Db2: Run SQL** from the menu.

5. Select the active Db2 database connection from the dropdown menu when prompted.

The query runs using the selected database connection, and the results appear in the Results pane
