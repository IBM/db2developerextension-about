# Creating a Simple SQL Statement

1. **Create and Save a New SQL File**  
   - Click **File > New File** or click the **Create New SQL File** icon in the Db2 Connections pane.
   - Save it as `anyname.sql` to enable SQL editing features.

   > **Note:** Although our examples use a `.sql` file, you can embed SQL in any type of file and run that SQL directly from Db2 Developer Extension.  
   See **Running SQL from different types of files** for more information.

2. **Write SQL**  
   - Begin typing `SELECT`.  
   - The extension will suggest the full statement.  
   - Choose **SELECT statement** from the suggestions to insert a code snippet.

   > **Important:** The snippet includes only basic parameters. Many SQL statements have a lot of parameters, so a link to the complete syntax is provided at the top of the snippet.  
   Syntax elements are color-coded for clarity. Hover over squiggly-underlined elements to see error messages and suggestions.

3. **Click Run**  
   - View the results in the **Results window**.
