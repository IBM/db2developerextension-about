Stored procedures are a powerful tool for increasing the performance and efficiency of distributed applications. Db2 Developer Extension currently supports native SQL stored procedures. These are procedures written entirely in SQL and created using the [CREATE PROCEDURE](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/12.1.x?topic=statements-create-procedure-sql) or [CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2/12.1.x?topic=statements-create-procedure-sql) statement. 


Native SQL stored procedures run inside the Db2 database engine without requiring external programs or languages.
